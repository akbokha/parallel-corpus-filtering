the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
further information on using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Setup extensions .... Open the map tool and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the package node ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools cras@@ hes . then you can view the page that has crashed &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of cras@@ hes if present .
the module view filter ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools In@@ sight filters . you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or with the module ; you can filter the current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View is that ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies can be displayed graphi@@ cally with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily recognized , can be easily detected when viewed at the bottom of the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View color mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of the sh@@ ading depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used ( whereby the display errors occur due to the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
with display algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . parameters are drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this framework needs space , which then is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is quad@@ ratic .
how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . it is always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry above the menu item View View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .

&amp; Edit ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; Edit ; try to make reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you use these short@@ cuts , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; Edit ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; website to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for login in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; Edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder here . just enter path names or click the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; Edit ; will you additionally use as an al@@ ame library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; Edit ; looks every sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed . during browsing the folders you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; Edit ; thirst recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . this lets you insert exceptional and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo out of the album and using this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; Edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , then Edit &amp; Edit ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ .@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device .
&amp; Edit ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and broad@@ casts are slow over the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read@@ out the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ ti@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes to &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put a picture in another part of the al@@ ame tree , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that one image can &apos;t be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed at present in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this is indicated as a symbol view . which fields can be displayed you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ name properties or the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . to do so , select Import Pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to include information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos if you want to sort or delete albums from the tool list . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the Settings for Coll@@ ections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date .
the El@@ dest , average , New Year &apos;s buttons : these set the date on one of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead .
if you first have an album in &amp; Edit ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; Edit ; supports entering keywords for single photos in the My Key@@ word List at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures in this album will be displayed in the frame window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information about each image will be displayed below the respective preview . what information this is , you can change settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; select the Albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to suit your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you want to let the mouse @-@ cursor rest for a moment over a picture , the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such an auxiliary window .
photos are all that comes with &amp; digi@@ kam ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ .@@ You can choose between viewing the pictures , a slideshow or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... . in the Edit section ; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; Edit ; the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the Open menu . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . by doing so , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; Edit ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to right click the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you have the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; Edit ; delete it into the tr@@ ash bin from &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete .
the View &amp; quot ; My date list ; organize your photos based on the data . &amp; Edit ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change to the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word li@@ ste@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so , you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when &amp; digi@@ kam ; the pictures will be noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and putting it down there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selected in the context menu keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click on the image with the right mouse button and select Add as an album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use this functionality with keywords , first you have to provide your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag and drop them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords ; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails of the images and select cue points from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear in the main window when you preview the picture .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Key@@ word menu . the menu displays only the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the time beam view displays a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
when you click on it , the filter is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the results will be displayed in the View list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option from its context menu .
when you select Search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select Exp@@ anded Search , the dialog for Advanced Search will appear to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search . see the tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu Search .
the Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules will be added by operators separated , or deleted . each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ... You can create Search of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one . by using a sponge , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . here , too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can scroll in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course assumes that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; Edit ; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; Edit ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and drop it there . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window pane is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize thumb@@ nails from the toolbar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then these are also carried out with the other image . you can thus compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly sorting out of a series of images . if you navigate pairs from the toolbar , then the first two pictures are automatically loaded into the sections to be compared . use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it in the right pane . this simplifies it through a number of similar images .
of course , normal extingu@@ ishing operations also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it e.g. easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can recognize on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will display the same image area .
zoom works as well as in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan , and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect , and use your images . we focus on the process for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , sorting , converting , group@@ ing , backing , viewing , scanning , archiving , maintenance , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data , which provides information on or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find a certain photo without inventory administration . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use definitely not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees a very fast search and a secure archiving to which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in the same location several times in one year . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend that you save the metadata option in the Edit Settings page in &amp; Edit ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so , Edit &amp; Edit ; provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now , the real work starts , because you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during further work .
let us now continue with keywords , keywords , as you can often refer to other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ ged images from another source with embedded keywords , then Edit &amp; Edit ; automatically mount the tree for you or insert the images in the correct place . re@@ sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree on another .
the graph shows how different metadata is over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation because every block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer to it , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . wow ! you begin to dream associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others viewing your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help Him over the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; Edit ; you can save as much text as you want , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) . you can even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your pictures to web galleries , then these labels will not tell the story a second time for the publishing .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become deeper in the future . I am sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographic details . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note on the author field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the image to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , those cau@@ tious must be handled and you may not get trusted for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection , they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to be a miracle for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and then store at a clean , dark dry and protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides on this subject a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
soon : dis@@ cos are the longest if you are operated at temperatures ranging from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reason is that S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ min@@ ent failure . this is especially read errors and publisher counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account for much , this is different with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , as these also feature a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a few seconds failure can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and shut down the system . if you buy an UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of power failure with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services rendered to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more dramatically .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies the offer contains a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you should open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebooks and 46 % in the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the percentage of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most think . it leads to less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stop settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteri@@ or@@ ate . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
so you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . therefore , make your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft mis@@ fortun@@ es : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for data loss is panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
full backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two times : that of the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes to a compression system closest to the exception that is only scanned and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure gives you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC information stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ assess as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to for@@ ego a certain al@@ ert@@ ness . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and the area you want to expand on a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of the disk if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard which should replace GIF . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store Gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open crude image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ its to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers now provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it some@@ time .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the resource block quot ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP will fit as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider using D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera edi@@ um are , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine layer editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; Edit , then you should add the metadata again . under certain circumstances , these have been cut off from the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Adding video to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras , this may take a while . when the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
tab Metad@@ ata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected button is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not yet been downloaded by &amp; Edit . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you use the All or Sel@@ ected Download buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the section My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete selected ones .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ kam album before you delete it from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase it from the camera , you should do so through the camera system , as this is much faster .
cameras use as file names for the photos often not meaningful names . the file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you upload photos from different shooting sets to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was made .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the Options Dur@@ ing the transfer , three more options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can e.g. use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do so , switch the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera file name option , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower@@ case . or upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window .
&amp; Edit ; can use all the information about the camera &apos;s orientation at the time point recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , it can &amp; Edit ; use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album when downloading . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data bar , you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you will need to turn on this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based bottom at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their machine to their camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; node ; methods .
after the image selection is done , question &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position specified in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and that can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can use one click to open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that Siemens v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ editing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and last via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic allocation .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of hair@@ y co @-@ ordin@@ ates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; Edit ; try to give as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to set up the Edit menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; set if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also during database synchronization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be names like e.g. hired photographer , freelance photographer or an independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently in the image and not only in the Edit Database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; Edit without getting lost .
image lab@@ eling as embedded in@@ scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read from other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter hangs over a file in the main window . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; Edit ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types and digi@@ kam ; try , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions from &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the illuminated table by &amp; digi@@ kam can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one then you can get better view results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you are using the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light color in the picture . these colors are defined here . in image editing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that image data requires more time to expand and pack . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression .
the TIFF files option can be used to comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the ability to save loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam ; the image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . this dialog allows you to change the image editing settings .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned into , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed light , as a continuous white . use the setting of continuous white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much colour or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the Edit &amp; Edit Image options . to keep the time for the demo session small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ invo@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process in order to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data , which comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like that . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ization Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ zing , since you are performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavi@@ ors If a picture is opened in image processing / ink management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ der Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; Edit ; examine these folders during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when you open the raw file later .
the ink management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which do not include color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with Canon models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portraits and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be downloaded by &amp; Edit ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the Pre@@ view .
short@@ cuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts .
for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please use the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features on the left hand side show a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the picture @-@ display mode . below there are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / h , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to display mode and turn on .
try out if &amp; Edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can show the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; set a photo in an album while del@@ eting a photo . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be applied sil@@ ently by &amp; Edit ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the Change button .
you can also set the display of the Welcome screen from &amp; Edit ; tie at startup . this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the En@@ m Start search for new photos constra@@ int &amp; Edit ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; Edit ; you decide if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; Edit ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the Pre@@ view and selecting the My Display / Edit menu .
image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; Edit ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up the section image editing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fier and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save As .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or the button The Rest@@ ore image editing button in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since last saving .
virtually any image editing action can be und@@ und@@ ated or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by modi@@ fying or re@@ restoring working from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should check the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z , and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; click the return button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom in and out into the photo by using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : automatically choose magni@@ fier
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you will come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool bar will be displayed . if you do not want this , you can change it in the Edit menu ; Edit main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; node ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . all image projections can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Print Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the Text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always performed when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword review shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously applied in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word . you can thus quickly limit the number of options in search for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword in the IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , it will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword keyword section .
the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their Album , - Date , Key@@ word and Search views . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears that promp@@ ts you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and have created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search using all the items in the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the Group button . the options then look like this :
why didn &apos;t Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r be listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason you use a color managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information on color management . additionally , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by email or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use a different color space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to sound my monitor when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your monitor is set to s@@ RGB . if you are working as s@@ RGB , you must either install your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alization , balance , automatic balancing and contrast extend from the Cor@@ duc@@ er Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the luminous intensity values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the balance achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and real@@ ising all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a little limited because it has a color space of 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far away from the original image , areas can occur with over@@ exposure . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Col@@ ors White Balance of the Image Processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as the vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right there is a hist@@ ogram that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your score depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is shown as a pure indicator in the preview and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the color management chapter .
another important tool is to find color value correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provides you with four color effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter at your disposal .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently revers@@ ed the development of the picture . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to fine @-@ tune this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically feasible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment eventually creates a negative image that does not produce photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works on ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
the tool tone correction is based on the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of sli@@ ders for the application described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and that can be shifted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controls and watch how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is often the most useful . in images , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ p@@ ette can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ bs that can be used to change the output values as interactive as in the input values . for example , the output values can be used to create a background image as background while something else is to be seen in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the pres@@ et values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is changed by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become dark@@ er .
if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shade and sun shades were set with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the Edit channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color nu@@ ances of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controller for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to save lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the option mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . colour space consists of small room art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . preserving the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image can be seen in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm light and middle tones as he adds a bit cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the fate of a pressure and the re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; Edit ; apply Tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the Edit menu ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to retain his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture , it surrounds it with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce transforms it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bot@@ tled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . width ranges from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you used the tool according to the aspect ratio previously used .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image in any position . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use@@ . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; Edit ; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Tools menu can be used in image editing to create templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button reduces the image underneath . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; Edit ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process requires colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in blur@@ red edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more after@@ ward sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images a camera has often been used for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ness while reading the image . if you disable it , you get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the sharpen@@ ing tool . this can be done using the Cor@@ duc@@ er Focus menu entry .
you should be careful about this because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is re@@ focusing the tool . you can re@@ focus it via the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t . under re@@ focuss@@ ing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool to shar@@ pen sof@@ tness with the Cor@@ duc@@ er sof@@ tness menu entry and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . this sets the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined with it for an edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ pen and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image that ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.@@ 0 .
the Edit &amp; Edit ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted resolution filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to focus an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which it revers@@ es the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus mostly achieves better results as blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixels . in most cases the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in the correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is 0.0@@ 3 .
G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is hot . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave uncomfortable art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the blur@@ ring Mas@@ k@@ ieren uses a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ness .
in theory , un@@ sharp masks must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Wiener Filter , it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red color image has to be corrected . this image has been made using an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the correction of sharp@@ ness in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the controller smooth@@ ness of the area has been dark@@ ened so as to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows for a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to fine @-@ tune the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smo@@ othing . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since then it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : specifies how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 suff@@ ices .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts will be corrected . the module is used in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip . the original image is to be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus sm@@ ashing smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the field of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the distance between the filters for@@ wards to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : check the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas which are typically more ru@@ ff@@ led . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow ranges .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear at the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier to shar@@ pen than a picture . use the tool to shar@@ pen soft marks with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture replacement is performed with a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some ranges even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can inter@@ rupt the calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
below you can reduce as a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious picture on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly with high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels that will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure times . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the Edit ; Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead , vig@@ net@@ tier@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the lens filter , which increases the necessary shutter time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should , even with center filters , use an opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s Fil@@ men@@ und of the color and grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image without the filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three other expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light strength absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly at a luminous intensity of 2 . increase the density by a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
luminous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , because you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a luminous and contrast correction was also carried out with the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but th@@ rows off at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second count . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth count . this value appears more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; verti@@ ces &apos; has the reverse mark of the parameter in general .
zoom : this value will scale the image size and result in a correction of the first degree . negative values enlarge while positive image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the sound and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best carry out this correction as the first . if you want to re@@ ap a picture and then perform a t@@ onal correction the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ - / kis@@ sen@@ oid@@ al distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the Trans@@ forming C@@ utter from image editing or the Zoom knob of this dialog .
for most images , the tone @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some images , such as shots from the front , frame and picture , is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the Add movie grain option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos since colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter movie grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix great silver particles of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ining effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the movie gra@@ dation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined part is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and G@@ lä@@ se@@ 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sketch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline yourself .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ity shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped into wax . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter en@@ grav@@ ings is a fast tool to recre@@ ate your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects take long time to compu@@ te and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ed from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image by a random shift of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this makes it natural for your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can hold with the Edit ; Edit an area free of rain@@ drops . to do this , use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning it . you can find the tools in the menu Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming Spi@@ ders .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ be@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . to do this , select Trans@@ form Size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smo@@ othing . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose . each setting for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and later loaded again .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and drag a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Stop button .
you can see below an example for photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . image editing allows you to use the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle when you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by moving at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button Der Zu@@ cli@@ de button of image editing in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save File Save or File Save entries in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
trimm@@ ing the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
in the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool according to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimm@@ ed image and not the original image .
the sett@@ ling assistance settings allow you to hide help , so that you can put together your pictures better . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ level rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we perceive as beautiful .
the golden split is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden split in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of its two preceding figures . the divi@@ der divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will give you good results for your shots to achieve your goal . compared to the third @-@ level rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angle is used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirr@@ oring and vertical mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy for you to hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which the objects are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can fix this with the Edit ; Edit and the tool free rotation . choose Trans@@ forming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are shown in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting from image editing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
corner left at the top : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
corner left below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you will receive un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction . for example , a horizontal shot will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
sh@@ ear@@ ching your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can drag horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the Sch@@ illing Tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single shot , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two sh@@ utter@@ ing is twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shot , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ formations from the image processing .
&amp; Edit ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give here a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; Edit ; displays only files in formats that you know . this happens based on file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file in image editing will be displayed . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find more information in the section configuration .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images . in doing so , redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very useful tut@@ orials in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the section configuration , you will find more information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ .@@ With this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; Edit ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; Edi@@ ting ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; Edit ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program to play back .

many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft marks , noise suppression , re@@ focus , blur@@ ring mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before applying the filter to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the state of the filter on the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nail area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizontal dividing without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left area shows the original and the right hand to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontally divide . the upper part shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nail area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can scroll in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course assumes that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files by &amp; k@@ de ; installed can be considered either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; node ; Settings and hot Custom Color and Fin@@ ally used colors .
in the Load palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders according to files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it displays the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check@@ box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . you can set this mode by selecting the check box under the C@@ ursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; node program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphics ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; node ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re @-@ calcul@@ ates the graph and displays in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph . required are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ viewer ; without launching an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file open and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog File .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the screen@@ shot below :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview from the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; can also note your decision so that later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ Viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ene file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ Viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cal@@ viewer ; instance or want to present the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether or not the parts of the graph come to a page to be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .

here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for un@@ executed graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm creates a spring model layout for un@@ finished graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istik , and contains a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .

the K@@ IP@@ I module reads pictures and provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you scan the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default default values for your image . look at the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image using the button Scan . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner .
make sure the window will be displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the button Scan you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; choose or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting Import &gt; Screen Photo ... from the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the entire desktop , only the window under the mouse will be read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the options of the target image will appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send your photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , show the photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Export module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . thus , it is used for your authentication . thus , it is your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can register for Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful login the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the Export module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog showing the current access permissions that the module displays . at present , the module does not support any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the Add Photos button should once be pressed after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos starts to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words separated by comm@@ a . these will be added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the Open , Friends and Family options , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the Change option to select the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value given in maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the geographic location of the K@@ IP@@ I allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image &apos;s metadata . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to perform a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the time zone must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and the camera . if the deviation is below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a location for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a series of photos at the same location . since the dialog moves the coordinates from a call to the next , you only have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and reset with the displayed map . choose the region in question and zoom in again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the selection tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you will not need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab appearance defines the overall look and layout for each page . the option For each image creates a page created a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page opens in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ exter@@ show
the Reiter Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all its associated images . choose a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other color depth setting you can change the default color depth , which naturally influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as twi@@ sting , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality and metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Digital Camera Client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the destination image .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at le@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ ders module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file in the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as far as possible .
if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can use the encoding button to start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go fast or in all rest a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if a critic appears that coding or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages via the Settings button at the bottom .
the print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve you or print out the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or later to use them elsewhere , you shouldn &apos;t choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the convert program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ code and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can reduce or increase the image . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : resi@@ zing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the pictures window will be shown with the images you have selected . you can add additional images via the button images using a file selection dialog . for the last image selected you will see a preview on the right side .
you can drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button Remove Images the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format in the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted in loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions about how to display your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have an appropriate graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the File Name option ensures that the file name of the images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . afterwards , you can cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose to show that the images are displayed in a random order . so the order of the pictures is not used in the album .
between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual pictures can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show the presentation to your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , every transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can play with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see the picture . as you can see by comparing with the picture , there are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you click with the mouse on the entry Per@@ sons , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name . you can use a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , which is of course also true for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , please select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must define yourself which image to be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you will need to select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and display the Add Categories Editor in the context menu . now you can customize the image for the respective person . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the Label or Description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. , 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are m@@ apped .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try functionality , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry C@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a co@@ hesi@@ ve HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the time line can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the time line can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries view view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of that date will appear in the preview pane ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , in the preview view only pictures of that period are displayed . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described ; integrated version that you can create through the File HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Target . in the following , each area is described more closely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . additional information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer even without description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all pictures are exported . you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically received .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 does not have to download any images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL you specify here should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them there . thus , the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that have just been described have related all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not even make this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported into and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file , or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that you can share this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for ex@@ porting images you can call through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the Manual option near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are standard Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option on this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu file , select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import into which folder you want to import pictures .
it may be that you specify the category of persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named for your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to import are to be imported and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , over ( 2 ) searching and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top file of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are saved and automatically re@@ stores it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... enter a window to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will learn the various settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can click on the F1 key by pressing a button and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places , and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the Options section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete members &apos; groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained .
in the list below , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; its modular system shares with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug @-@ in Interface . additional information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules cannot and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most of the modules have a help page , which you can call through the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album have been tested only very little . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . demo database you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are arran@@ ging their pictures into albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates order after albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album has to be released &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules are also presented with a list of albums . here &apos;s a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category individuals , you will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass on this to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain much information as you have not yet entered any information about your images . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to mark any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each picture either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by specifying people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be m@@ apped , you can , by means of the names used up , to find the persons quicker and assign them .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date on the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add notes to them . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are located below the thumb@@ nail on the right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . also , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and store it in order to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this assumes that you are currently sorting your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window from a frame by pulling it out of the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... that offers you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or of all the pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; i.e. , use pictures without you being saved on the hard drive . of course you need to have the images stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures , where the right upper corner is truncated , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy and copy files from folders . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not yet support you to insert the respective CD . therefore , if you want to avoid trouble , how to avoid mess@@ ing up your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures .
in the Image menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the images in such a way that at the end are those that you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click to lock all the pictures that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu entry Any@@ thing out of the current view .
with this you have set the pictures to be hidden in case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to lock images , so that all the pictures you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to deny the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . it of course shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and out into the image . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom in again The Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the function key , the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that come in and out with the plus and minus key are .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view it Cancel and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to mark the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to create pictures with features while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the attributes A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in your browser . so if you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add all the images at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make straight .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to view categories in the In@@ sight view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow you &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can und@@ o your painting later .
in order to disable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the image on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
in order to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , as all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry from the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply , or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
click Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture will be rendered , even if you want to render only one part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window layout or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag it to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the Beg@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the Beg@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the Beg@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the inf@@ estation bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the inf@@ anti@@ le bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any position .
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... saving it . a dialog will appear where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon icon in the toolbar or select the View Sc@@ ene menu item .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a fast preview up to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Save modes from the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but it makes sense to have a name that lets you know the properties of the mode .
in the chart map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the quality drop down sel@@ ector you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . the standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super sampling includes the adjacent pixels . recur@@ sively , because each pixel is distributed again and again , because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray uses a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values of the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 is comp@@ uted with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this tab card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly completed , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import the scene , select Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . click here the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced Proj@@ ections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you tick the ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window instructions will explain how you can create and save window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list Exist@@ ing window classi@@ fications shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button .
new column lets you create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with un@@ ts you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating , the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result , you only receive a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
when you apply the Apply button or press the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a box ( insert final body boxes ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; indeed offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply or Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the plane , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite plane . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you view the object tree carefully , you will find that you can un@@ fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select First sub@@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = soil pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities again , but take the simplest now .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , then click on the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . you will need to enter two new attributes in the color list . select the color list in the object tree . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the check@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should already be easy to execute , since you should have understood the basic principles of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button ) , the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise the sphere would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in Sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere pigment , then select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the shine effect and reflection settings already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if Met@@ alli@@ c : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu , replacing the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved saving will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu item if you have previously used Edit .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
opens a dialog to set the tool@@ bars . with this option you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; command and remove commands .
a dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give color to the surface of an object color on a pixel basis by applying a image file as a colour chart .
&amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the Return key .
you can set if any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Di@@ alogue Configuration - &amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ de Show , you can set the working method of &amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; in the other two , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point activates , loads &amp; cube show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ o ; when you exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , open &amp; tap show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this will be used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; set up only a few of the file types that the program can display .
this option enlar@@ ges the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
determines whether the slideshow should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time interval between image changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of action at &amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; in the tab cards Sh@@ ort@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and implement corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least issues and potential improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to leave your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to encourage you to answer other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; and hopefully soon to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of the show@@ photo ; change . to access these settings , you need to choose Set Item in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicator area , you can select the color indicated when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show photo ; displays a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . the same page bar is also available in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes it easier to scan and scan images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save them . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or instantly save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also view the images before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; vo@@ g@@ ite ; with the command channel -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel is &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan for the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom in into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when you preview a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving must be selected a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this option allows you to select the type of a &amp; vo@@ g@@ ite ; to select images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save Option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix that is saved each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the knob Over starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; to quit .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and choosing global keyboard short@@ cuts . click the right mouse button in the player window and select Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; - short@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the Amar@@ ok D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script is not running .
beginners require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure specifies the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder on the folder where all the data should be saved .
track@@ Change Sign@@ aling that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to query more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work , for example , clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ o@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the gener@@ alization amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the -@@ p parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for just one particular song from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Coll@@ ections browser and quick search you will find the piece in seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . see the System Requirements section for details .
activates debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in the player window , the player window will turn on or off in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use mo@@ mo@@ bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
create more atmospheric design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with mo@@ od@@ bar support . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
store mood files in the music files : this feature is only available when compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the &amp; Amar@@ ok settings folder ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
when saving a playlist to the end of the playlist , the current playlist will automatically save &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
keeping up @-@ to @-@ date piece changes visible causes the playlist window to open / un@@ roll to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when changing the part to the context browser , the context browser automatically changes as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting fonts used the otherwise gray displayed section will be activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection selected below for foreground and background color .
continue playing at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it stopped at the last exit .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas will open the color selection dialog . if your own colors are not checked , the default &amp; node colors will be used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typing space holders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate more settings in this card .
the Map Collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders to browse through music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this will cause &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the checked and their sub@@ folders to music .
monitoring Chan@@ ges : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear in the playlist browser .
the Collection Database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation Field Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setting is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , enter the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send play pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible for Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
get similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , call &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we wrote a small guide on how to comp@@ ress k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ ant@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag library library . you can locate the file using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b cras@@ hes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to cras@@ hes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate automatically when in@@ active for ... to setting the sound system , or at least do not use any value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens during a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to the fact that many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but do not identify them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ inst@@ ated with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . this allows you to temporarily disable the status De@@ activates on Gra@@ y and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf in such a way that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are resolved easily by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if you have something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come into there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the interface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Tools Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view . click anywhere in the new review column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be What media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include a MP3 decoder in the default setting ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio at the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
it does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data at first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the ts@@ w@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause distorted playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Dri@@ vers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts Bu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less active the visu@@ ali@@ zations react . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run the start @-@ up register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok first ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files once as system administrator and once as your normal user . delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the most recent @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and I think the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let you run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user interface user name Amar@@ ok player @-@ now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace the IP address with your IP and your username with your user name . this assumes your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the resi@@ zable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button sets a piece in the queue to queue . pressing the enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the Control Panel ?
in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal read , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically , this adju@@ sts the previous evaluation with a decreasing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the playlist window . then , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the item and pressing Edit : select review or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that cannot be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . choose setup toolbar settings ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it then under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context browser design , click on New Design Inst@@ all ...
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor and control over &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cras@@ hes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably you will use a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok .
I receive the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to the G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad .
you will receive the There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card using Amar@@ ok ?
set up Amar@@ ok settings ... enter the audio output . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ ac@@ int@@ x@@ 0 { type he@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ pp@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type tap sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
set x@@ ine us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check@@ box in sound card support m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with arts is not taken care of . you can of course take this problem yourself ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed support for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
to create a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection facilitates the search for certain items . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them to save them with the help of the button in the playlist . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD from the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the audio cd : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have different ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some extra packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player Window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok control center . at the top of the window , there is a run@@ time display that displays the currently running piece or current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time for the remaining time of the play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the run@@ text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also available under the running context display . the PL@@ PL button activates or de@@ activates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set E@@ quali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece &apos;s position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 default settings , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that there is in no other player . however , don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use , yet powerful enough even for advanced users .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub @-@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub @-@ window has fallen off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to recre@@ ate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the Cover Administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played right away .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces from this interpreter . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the tracks in the individual sections to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the item or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the Text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click the text sub@@ window , try and Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is yet running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit Button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - In addition , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below there will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ts by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All the albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order . the interpreter will be ignored .
group Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your tracks are displayed first by genre and among them sorted by artist .
group Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works as well as the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ app@@ end your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
there is a search filter directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view and in the tree view . notes on using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box , which allows you to filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose various time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . furthermore , you can of course also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically disabled .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This feature inserts the selected pieces into queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
broadcast Media Player - Add the pieces in the queue to the media player . see the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned as either a data or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among various performers .
pick up a compilation marker - Change an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be shown under various performers but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intelligent Play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the playlist browser includes the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click to Add Intelligent Play@@ lists to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired tracks from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive integration for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because all files that do not match your search criteria are hidden in the file list .
in the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the mounting of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropping files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping . once you enter there characters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter wild@@ cards separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two , and three .
if you type OR between the search terms OR , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bathroom .
you can specify the sequence of entries of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some of the playlist features . on the left , you will find the Add button to which you can add the playlist to the playlist . to the right , you will find play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists , and shu@@ ffle .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up Tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for the playback position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the Status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . over this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
one click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting Ac@@ tions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management . choose from :
the queue administration received your big collection in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
the queue management will open you via extras queue administration . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next unit change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : setting Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button will empty the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit . this will open the dialog to edit the playlist settings .
enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the settings for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not be able to hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists that have been crossed .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking Configuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on script . it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug@@ ins is used to enable the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . in order to understand the steps you have to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will get a worse quality while encoding MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format . to do so , use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog window you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD into just four steps . in order to understand the steps you have to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible burning settings .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog window you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as reading the original into the image file is finished , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .

the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you can get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback there , use community help from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; to burn CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ ppers .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between various audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ MA@@ GER : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces will play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can inter@@ rupt the closing and keep the project open .
closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , which is to happen , just as if you had called for each project file C@@ lose .
closes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do , as if you called the C@@ lose file .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files to be added appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , which causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium , the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you create files for a multiple session CD . the data of the previous session are always included even if this function is not used . it is more likely to be used as help for you to view the files and folders already present on the medium .
this record only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only del@@ etes the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . converting / dimin@@ ishing a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not yet necessary , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the total ( video ) data of the source media in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely er@@ ase the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes Over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button .
a DVD video that has previously been loaded can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used stand@@ alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings and even options to change the size and to cut black borders .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view is switched on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow section that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part , you can adjust the key mapping for this further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so when you start the wizard you have to set the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; general application settings can be made here . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the D@@ CO@@ P , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be more important , which of the included programs give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( C@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / summer ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audio creator ; is an audio CD ; a reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily record audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and supported by many encoding enco@@ ders . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP3 or O@@ GG format or also other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything themselves . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not handle the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass a protected audio CD ; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; explained on the hard drive . this ( hopefully ) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . note that before the encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected for encoding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main Setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; with different cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate differences are less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices exists .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . requires less than 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex tracks of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car poster systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ San@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand @-@ commit / used with &amp; audio creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the hosts themselves . it is to be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( translation of the translator : this is meant by the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly available on CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio creator ; is active a check box to choose ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address defined in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between computers .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the update of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used for this purpose ; if you want to know more exactly , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the right distribution first if it hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) to the encoding of the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also necessary for the predefined enco@@ ders . more information about the enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read bar on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , since it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it ( eg by trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; audio creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . it is intended where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them at each reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your device . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if you can access the drive with other programs , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . there &apos;s not much to do here . here an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only with incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the cart@@ on card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , it is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ector fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but since many fire@@ walls bu@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more Happ@@ iness with protocol 80 , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of pieces at the same time : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after reading out the last piece : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to check out the CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , the path / folder must be specified where the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another disk . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if wished . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set of &amp; audio creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was written and furnished in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will be collected . the process described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we have a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully logged data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually insert data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , search for help in the section Questions and Ans@@ wers or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
note : if the CD is successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that best fits your &amp; CD ;
if you did not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; Settings dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments m@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the created files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the selected CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not provide the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items button on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection of the selection process started , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the jobs and follow what is going on .
click on the Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first item is currently scanned onto the hard disk . the status of the program will be shown in the lower left part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is encoding of p@@ cs 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and coding are parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in the case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; will maintain CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package today . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can already download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio creator ; install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you read this , you &apos;ve probably already done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many options . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different tabs of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication as to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of program start ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book on &amp; k@@ audio creator ; may it be done . at least after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke game from &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition to others , it also features real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the track .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop to drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will display the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the Play from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with multiple pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and passing the regulator back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display to change the playback speed . to restore the original speed , double click on the tempo LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry interval in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song ly@@ ric event and again other both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not have to manually adjust it . so , when you activate the automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the text events or properties from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you compose . these are played in the series . in this section is how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the selected items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider this if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when an automatic addition to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . the collection will then be added to the pieces that are to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu Order sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next song button , select next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ ferences item , the entry Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are not general MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the occur@@ ren@@ ces of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI map because all GM sound cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all required translations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except for the Key@@ map section , which may appear as many times as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different Text@@ ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patches from General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all tones that this instrument needs to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun . to do so , use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound is another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 listings .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sound on the percussion channel . see the accompanying Key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channels , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name Name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there are no dec@@ im@@ al quotes in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pres@@ ets that a keyboard that receives a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to play a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which tones are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select View from the View Channel View : settings
the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , and so on . thus , the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection previously . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; cons ; - Desktop open &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just change to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , switch to the automatic addition to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) .

I &apos;m trying to take some time for my hob@@ bies .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es
you are really looking forward to sending me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count amongst friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I only keep on programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch for AW@@ E cards was too high .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid , can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you can also find links to pages with more kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you obviously couldn &apos;t hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files from formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; it was not finished yet ; it was installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the site The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links from the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you are looking for an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ cked record .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; S@@ MB Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and select next edit mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you must select from the File menu with Play@@ list and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or any other group will be selected without comparing the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during start and finish can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / DATA@@ - / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / extrac@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing during the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite shot : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ current &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Video@@ . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; playing with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ ME ; it can even include the special em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog File Con@@ ordin@@ ations of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the Browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ MB players ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
in order to always take a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all the og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB Player ; can play cards from TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the S@@ ME , the dialog can be used in the Settings - &gt; Source &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , one of which is selected ( for example , it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contained a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Video@@ Player only can use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , therefore , it must include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , S@@ MEs are used for different names for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ sp@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they begin playing the playlist .
are there any clu@@ es on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as user root after mounting the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU has to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is ob@@ sol@@ ete . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

G@@ opher was originally started as a distributed campus information system from the University of Minn@@ es@@ ota . G@@ opher enables the user to access information stored on G@@ opher &apos;s on the Internet .
g@@ opher allows the user to save the position of a desired information in a book@@ mark ( Book@@ mark ) . thus , the user can navigate directly to the information with the help of the book@@ mark without having to search the entire menu . G@@ opher menus are not standardized , insofar as each g@@ opher server provides specific information .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ;
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the Ki@@ le ; website .
if you have any questions or if you compile , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the possibility to complete , compile , post @-@ process and troubleshooting within the source text as well as conversion and view tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities , the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; .
for &amp; latex ; is the right expression : lay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ ie ( in@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good view to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to be given . to be able to rule correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics like paper format , page number@@ ing and text fields are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick @-@ entry Assistant by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for the creation of the document . there can also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; projector &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : the character encoding of the system should be set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the preparation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see greater areas of a green text on screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment was not closed . however , it is due to the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and costs .
with the automatic completion of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { Command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line to define the command ( e.g. \ \ end { Command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into several elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when searching for a DVI ; file &#91; dependent file &#93; &#93; , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ Viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; -@@ Source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the loop search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source code is j@@ umped . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; latex ; the source code is j@@ umped to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewers j@@ umped .
master Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick installation : the latex ; source code will be compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in source ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is used on the combination of the other and the other , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick installation .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection boxes have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
the Other option is used to add items such as keywords , fu@@ zzy notes or references . the options available are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( choice of a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is shown . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ MY is used for defining the font size . it enables the font sizes to be specified for the main text , the joints , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and specifying settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not fixed at the beginning , this can also occur later in the text .
as soon as the above source example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the push button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the compilation of the document is missing , it should be sought in logging according to the errors . if it is used for quick construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report is created with the font 12 and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow for the revision of the font size within the environment .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no description ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities for the explanation of the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , there may be certain fonts , grease pressure , passive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is long until it is closed with a \ { end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once in the wizard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be made . to do this , make a quote , a few passages in the grease and passive pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl E can be converted back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it out and have fun .
DVI ; is a format @-@ independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ r. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , converting into desired other formats can begin by means of buttons in the toolbar .
the ad search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ dings . to do this , simply set up Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools Building to be selected .
to select the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on thumb@@ nail . the jump to the corresponding position in DVI ; the viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; - document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if you do not open the &amp; DVI connection , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be shown in the logging file or in the message window in summary .
the log file explains the source code error source . in the editor you can use the Pre@@ ferences La@@ Te@@ X error and errors La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the incorrect row , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the defective line .
as soon as the corresponding button is cli@@ cked on the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
hands @-@ on users of and latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file may be opened or a new file will be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard tags .
a template can be created from any and latex ; files are created in a simple way to create a template , and should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in menu tools directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities , the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical and latex ; command reference which can be inv@@ oked over the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ clicking with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only will be selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and emphasize the various types of source texts . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit jump marks or the corresponding key features allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this also highlights this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first entry of a sign .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers excellent possibilities , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; Also added many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit options , the following commands are included :
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only preventive thing in &amp; Ki@@ le is that the ab@@ uses are separated by two blank lines .
select the word from the current cursor position . this option also has an extended meaning , as this command also reads &amp; latex ; commands with a swa@@ p character ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to allow a part of the document , the first one can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit removal , the following commands are included :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to modify selected paragraph .
it was already clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly before the command to opening the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to tune the environment .
if the cursor is before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted environment commands , it is possible to get lost quickly . this command includes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from editing environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted welded groups par@@ enth@@ eses can quickly get lost of the eye view . this command includes the most recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple application notes are used as g@@ asses . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple note signs . also for ending the application , the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and includes two complete connecting notes for latex ; one .
this automatic addition of double application marks can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French application marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; enter key &amp; box ; enter an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ including an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be set in Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . if shift ; Alt ; amp ; seek &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the above line . although this tab is not possible to add , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; add some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; in order to provide special commands ( mostly for and latex ; ) . it is built for different modes . three of them work on demand and the other two are fully configured for different modes ...
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { Environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { Sur@@ ro@@ unding } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , as a result , the missing list can be cleared . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le , jumping marks can be added , so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing jumping stamp N@@ Ã ¤ table jump mark and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different wi@@ per lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as shelves of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the processing mode will result in a large list of surrounding commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the spac@@ eb@@ ar environment or key key Alt + Shift key Space key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient loss can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
after this has been done , the environment will be closed automatically . as soon as &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of missing mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of settings that are immediately replaced by multiple strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of an abbrevi@@ ation list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , contains the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word complete mode introduced over the menu processing complete or key key C@@ trl + Alt Space key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large shelves are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many wishes in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... Ki@@ le can be completely de@@ activated . here , the threshold value may also be specified for the display of the complete termination .
the data processing files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / Unit / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / contents of the Persian home folder . mode is available for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to see the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all tools are group@@ ed in groups in the creation comp@@ iling , creating changes and creating a view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for observer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by the key key Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and can be seen using the old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Installation command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open every time .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me pro@@ c and how superb it is . let &apos;s take it another piece , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; just click the icon for the XML processor and finish it !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the desired working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the desired folder in the folder of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said , everyone at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the newly opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current work folder selected . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then the current file is simply checked . if not , they delete the tick in the current file and select the file to be checked with other file - file cho@@ oser .
if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed Check selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file cho@@ oser . both for the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Relax@@ NG review is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality instantly and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can find more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin editing with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on one project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and their own identity are important in terms of messages and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for more information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project . one example would be to record the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the Reci@@ pi@@ ents list . the address sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see how such guides will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
input comments is simple . it can be selected either the comment entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the top name of the team member is , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Manager After the area and sub@@ project lad@@ ders , the corresponding area or sub@@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over some pages that are dealt with one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / Small writing of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower attri@@ bution of attributes : upper@@ case / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
automatically close the optional tags : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , it will be inserted immediately after the date .
automatically close non @-@ optional tags : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
start and end @-@ tag automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic realization of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : expression types for recognition of different types of files . the default setting can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file open @-@ open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regularly creates backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash , the document can be recovered from this backup when the program starts . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the default window settings to the next startup is useful when the user interface has been confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / dra@@ gging views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the warning of warnings by non @-@ ques@@ tioning of warning messages .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL@@ - and the source text view in the shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the illustration of the par@@ ser nodes in the document can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
the area for setting short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) that are un@@ folded when editing to more extensive text . short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third parties , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load a component in the &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ read K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , you can choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , debu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was adjusted , as well as support for the DB@@ G debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
when a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that displays the contents of monitored variables . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
depending on the supported features of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to debu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the View Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue .
instruc@@ t the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution will continue . if a script is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include files are corrected .
instruc@@ t the debu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there weren &apos;t the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression is to be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value for a variable .

document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; They enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types that include descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , icons @-@ oriented tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions more quickly insert into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars enable fast insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing like folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ ders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better viewing and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing but an element type above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using , att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in the Tag Editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of elements that termin@@ ate a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD editing D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c can be edited for a file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as Ni@@ ck@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... button . click New Action results in the same dialog :
this action assigned key short@@ cut . by clicking on the user defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) which can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . for example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts local script folder : $ PAT@@ H / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text unique is app@@ ended to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be entered by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field , you can specify what to send to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exported application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , written to the standard error output . it can be specified , what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output :
when there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to specify actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete all and , if the Tag has attributes and you are planning their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag , &quot; if available so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Gra@@ ph More Software ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regards to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some divi@@ ders . open the tool bar to set the dialog on Settings toolbar . make sure that the tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the item to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this will add the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by trying to hal@@ ve all the symbols to make sure everything is working .
secure in the correct folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Your description for these docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = h@@ func@@ 1.@@ html func@@ 2 = h@@ func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # capability Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ ax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently on top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that serves to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but be proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places , there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to send email , tool lists toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team considers them to be accurate and useful for publication . in order to make a thorough contribution , we recommend the resources to be signed , for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or if you have several keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading toolbar toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be cancelled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be necessary . there is the easier way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ et .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description to be used . then the following dialog will appear :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that will appear in the ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to be able to understand them and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used , available , and stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can personally use them .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; -@@ Pat@@ terns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ ges the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in and for further information about these areas .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other , or all the tabs , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse cursor , help the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the Editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as default , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow for information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open them and to ro@@ am . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the then displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are usable only in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking on the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as starting , editing , or sending an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her the tree opens .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , many attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the content @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed tar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not execute here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; designed for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or execute help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , with the oldest entry being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when past@@ ing from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; cap@@ itali@@ zation that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script outputs error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the debu@@ gger .
initial and Swit@@ ching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
Browse the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available modes of transport depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , managed the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project files / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set with actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars will be stored on toolbar toolbar , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
remove a toolbar from the field of vision . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
loading a &amp; D@@ TD ; which you or someone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh entities from the D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu default in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of tools denied that this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
the plug @-@ in menu lists the available plug @-@ ins in the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the current version .
choose the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who are using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .

immediate change@@ over between the different types of the user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window respectively .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the editor window &apos;s behavior . see &amp; k@@ ate documentation for details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences .
this should generate a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , as , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hook up .
with this option all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the Profile sub@@ window or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the selected debu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the Profile sub@@ window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration dialog , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar . the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right mouse button context menu :
different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in the main memory and forgotten in the end of the program . this option is useful if frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk option is not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o sla@@ ves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or a danger . use them at your discretion . the password is hidden on the disk so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool bar , accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to design the toolbar . adding and adding is different . adding tool lists is treated below in the Adding tool bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be removed , toolbar names or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and setting settings actions ..
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents can be created in corresponding sub@@ folders . it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . see in for more information on the template tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can contain everything , from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template Save As Local template ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look under project templates in the template tree .
select text in your document and click File As template saving selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view Tem@@ plates .
creating binary templates is simple : just copy the file to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ type header lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically create with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the Tem@@ plates sub@@ window is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / apps and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set up , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or re @-@ identified templates for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) using a complete command set for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source editor if necessary , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green icon displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ aut of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit and PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that both the source editor and the V@@ PL editor are visible and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor activated in sync . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is already active , puts the touch of the active cursor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this is used to reduce the manual coding .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click in the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible exactly as with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted through typing and del@@ eting by button or distance button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags does not remove , for example , if an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor day .
some tool@@ bars such as the She@@ ets Assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool lists .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be tra@@ cked .
to be able to compile successfully , except for lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
hold in a template , at one point in a sty@@ le- or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed re@@ taining points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a file name without path input . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with each my@@ QNA@@ P@@ host containing the template string .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will &amp; eg ; extends to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a specified stopping point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

multiple commands require more than one argument . quote characters can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &apos; argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only of ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see exactly what was changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge the entire folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and compar@@ es the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more h@@ ass@@ le if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ from files .
if all files have the same name , but are located in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
c@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder folder folder 1 folder 2 folder folder 2 folder folder 1 folder 1 folder folder folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog displays your selection and displays it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
via the button Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing or mer@@ ging folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C , a folder then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then begins immediately . in the Open dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at present , you can do nothing of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only dropping text in a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each Info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for this is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when comparing three files . this is to be seen in the next section ( merge ) .
if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is represented on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an Info line with the output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Chang@@ ing &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the jump to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group then becomes the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and may still choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and copy somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignore options or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly to the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl beginning and C@@ trl end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the Pa@@ ste button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the top of each group ( as already explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / previous difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / C@@ trl @-@ picture downhill ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . therefore , conflicts between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you will need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . if enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and eliminating manual copying . be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line end@@ ings are stored according to the underlying OS . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the game and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; Set@@ ting up K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be represented . on these systems the button Pre@@ ferences automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ regulated color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of whit@@ esp@@ ace characters will be inserted when the tab@@ ul@@ ator key is pressed . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual to the clip@@ board is not necessary .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all the fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a cart return mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others only store a new@@ line slot &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , carriage returns are made visible , but if this option is checked , this option will be disabled . during the merge , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
this option is disabled by default . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
the option is activated by default . it is effective for complex and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the section to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be added to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change becomes active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally across the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the encoding fields for encoding a short notice of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn on this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after choosing A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will display a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply open the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the pop @-@ up menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function , for example , for cutting of annoying parts or for correc@@ ting ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line reconciliation to convert the input into upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all will follow the same pattern $ keyword generated $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $
while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line reconciliation . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging . further operations change only the data that the new@@ line algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ like pre @-@ processor will see the output of the normal processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate mer@@ ging and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually carrying out them ,
... perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folder , a small message window will inform you about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or using the arrow keys for left / right .
double clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case , the mer@@ ging action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as can be seen in the picture above , colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . with folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : contradictory file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : contradictory file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ safe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
while mer@@ ging , one file is processed after the other . it displays skill when mer@@ ging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then the C will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , B is chosen as the target and the A and / or B will be used as the target when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : choose directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid merge actions still exist by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box will pop up with the Options , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select Start / Continu@@ e directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cras@@ hes on a bug , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to try the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been individually merged , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later merge of all entries . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be specified with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous poin@@ t. marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled by default .
if the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is disabled by default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed benefit will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled by default .
similar to the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is disabled by default .
enables synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered in@@ secure because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will receive the .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ or@@ g extension already exists , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of single files , not just the merge of entire folders .
usually the folder merge view remains visible during the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can split the option directory &amp; text window and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory -@@ menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to merge the folder merge . to do so , use the current file merge from the merge menu .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory :
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the enti@@ t@@ lements or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differ@@ encing viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In@@ K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original file from the patch file . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 starts ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view In - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; run as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called Com@@ pare ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or want to go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t give the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . by default , configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines to each other , this is the same , but this is the case .
the editor notes for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , it suddenly stops ; No sr@@ c has been left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have trouble comp@@ iling . should you still encounter difficulties , please report to the mailing lists .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift removal ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift insertion ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
it will only show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C buttons below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , finish them or move them . this works in both a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries to set up p@@ ager ... and exit . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work surfaces .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display ; show the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ N grid , as is known from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical range , which is very well suited for presentation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch setup ... the dialog settings will appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign this value to it . possible values are :
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen motion . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you are reading a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the image displayed in the magni@@ fying pane is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in default size &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; this causes a selected area of the screen in the magni@@ fication window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the position of the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop down mode , you can customize the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fier window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , or push the &amp; M@@ MB , you can post@@ p@@ one the selection box .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short@@ cuts to save files , open a new window , print , virgin ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Sm@@ aller &amp; etc ; .
may also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to enlarge the screen size , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ severe for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive strain in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the bare moving of the mouse pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that causes pain when you click with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic relief aids : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you pause the motion briefly .
if the smart move is enabled , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it has em@@ ulated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out .
when Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the shooting time is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button wait before it release the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back guides a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and select the General tab . there is a sli@@ der control sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this feature is currently only available in &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . once you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand@@ by after clicking Apply .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you then have become used to automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to change the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of what position a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not link leads to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first of all you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a move , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by letting the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can even run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . this way you can no longer cause the mouse clicks to cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select the text by clicking a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button clicks a sound like a mouse click plays . so you know exactly when the move time starts with the smart moving . later , you can also use the intelligent move without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain of the mouth .

mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the conversation history phrases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command which will later be used for the speech output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text@@ book . from the text@@ book text@@ books you can choose often used text passages without typing them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word @-@ completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an in@@ let memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have set up your mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . any spoken sentence will be app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again .
with the Settings menu entry ; setup ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two tabs , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page as well as the side of K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the tab card speech output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop down box under the input field , insert the character encoding , with the text passed to the voice generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should be passed on to the voice generator as the default input . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output is currently being developed . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after choosing a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage text@@ book or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage is spoken directly to the input field and the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field with the selection of In the input field .
with the second selection box C@@ lose the edit window for text pass , you can specify whether the text pass book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger site contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; K@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically insert new words into the dictionary , in the course of time create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window to edit text pass books is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either via the selection in the menu bar , toolbar , or drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected sentences in the default memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar can be placed directly under the menu bar . clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated , if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is mounted directly under the tool bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the speech output properly or not fully . open settings to mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the file menu speech output . ( see Settings dialog for Voice Syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the Festival for free and without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ ett . the speech output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ th and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ sts / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option must be turned on as default input .
the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; K@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text pass through the machine . it is a list of already spoken sentences stored which the user can re@@ issue repeatedly .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; there is no voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .

before you can use it , you need to install and adjust program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
at the first start of t@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the tab General will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . a combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is called a speaker .
different actors for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card reader narr@@ ator in kt@@ mu@@ gr , the card reader is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already established appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for speech output if an application does not give a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
select here a type of tuning , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the card reader . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can almost use it . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to make text read . click on the map file to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language delivery system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the tab card is displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; on , provided the Voice Output field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the Control Panel system , it will disappear again as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this line you can start , Cancel , stop and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all settings changed on all pages .
the cart@@ on card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that is to be read and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; header lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that is to be read and select Tools text in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events you specify . you can also read the text of these messages by kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , in such a way that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the scope of delivery by &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent to K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; t@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; t@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is processed in filters before being sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of text .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
News is the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who steps into the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you expect from the card reader is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just reading such a screen , this output is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
character substitute replac@@ ers replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; t@@ ts ; will be delivered with predefined string replac@@ eable filters , which allow replacing chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; t@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with language selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card reader , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules for which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filter will be dra@@ ined from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be shown below .
for setting up string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it just has to differenti@@ ate itself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ bet column . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to scroll the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the &amp; C@@ trl ; key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can get the application @-@ ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID header @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only input cop@@ ete .
the string replace filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen Filter box if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. so the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to summari@@ ze these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; - Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the box .
&amp; XML ; transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
set the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable using the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c also suff@@ ices .
with the telephone selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card reader , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program pres@@ ets , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the characteristics of the speaker arranged on the tab card speaker . using the microphone selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system the &amp; node ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your language settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen Filter box if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the Language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; for both APIs , see the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; trans@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for Festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you have to do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the PAT@@ H environment variable .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or just gi@@ b@@ ish fade . what can I do about it ?
first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string replace filter . see .

American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ d .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not yet contained in this manual .
the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archives for you , or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you are using a speech syn@@ thesizer , first make sure that your speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of t@@ ms@@ gr to use the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ chers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can go back to sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or break the output .
if an application displays text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise automatically the most appropriate speaker is selected . if you want to learn more about it , see how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker .
when you click Add Fol@@ der on the tab card , and thus insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the tab Spe@@ aker Setup will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival .
select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , which are &amp; t@@ ts ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the syn@@ thesi@@ zed speech . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice you selected does not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after startup , only the desktop icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card reader .
using the buttons in this row , you can go forward or return on the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and numbered to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio tab . see also .
here you will find and manage text orders . screen @-@ Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and Mess@@ ages will not be displayed . for more information on the message types of kt@@ ts , see here .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or trac@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 5@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ml ; % roughly the double normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works for you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this tab card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language records :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after reading the output of the screen reader , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and expenses of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ No@@ tify news , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click No@@ tification . the card reader notification appears .
select this check box to enable &amp; node reading ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read before .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what and t@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card reader .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All messages for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . to do so , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard includes marks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival uses in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single phrases . this can be done faster with reading , since only the first set needs to be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the entire text order . this allows you to skip or stop forwarding orders on the card board , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the set @-@ level detection filters . at the first start of &amp; t@@ ts ; a set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add additional pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , however beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to get started is to set up the selection of speakers by trying out . switch on the selection of speakers and enter text to read . check the selection of the speakers again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes . for that , you must of course have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; t@@ ts ; then faster with pre @-@ reading can begin , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can pause or cancel text orders on the card pass , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
flag Reco@@ gnition Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ level detection filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c included in &amp; kt@@ ts .
you can over@@ write the language settings for the application on the card reader selection menu .
using the standard speaker ( the top one on the card reader speaker ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
using the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ t ; select this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything .
mark this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field of speakers that best correspond to the following , click the Standard Spe@@ aker button and then use the speaker closest to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without the order number , the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ mu@@ g cras@@ hes immediately when it is started . I have compiled debu@@ gging support , but I do not get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is termin@@ ated . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is possibly installed . you may try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music with another application at the same time . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; t@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find clu@@ es for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an extra voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but it doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / call@@ backs . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer even on the card reader device a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the speech speed settings are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML trans@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set the speech speed up .
I don &apos;t manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival or@@ ator , but &amp; t@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . to make this festival no error , the x@@ s@@ l file acc@@ uses S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own drawing c@@ assette replacement filter and now I can proceed in &amp; t@@ ts ; do not move either forward or backward . on the index page orders are displayed , the job consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for punc@@ ture detection instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the start register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ ast@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts in the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system also matters , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . moreover , it freezes when you pause a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not yet support real p@@ auses . if you are holding a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
if you have downloaded tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :

the following modules for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option column indicates the configure parameter which causes the passing of the parameter .
the default value is set in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . for example

configure cd script make su pass@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd t@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use it , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good and there are multiple voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help is provided in the instructions provided with the Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of Festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software at festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ lli@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ lli@@ c like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice @-@ sharing system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . for more information see below .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this method uses special code to give the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; grab and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into an appropriate folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file Festival must lie in your PAT@@ H .

Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ian voice syn@@ thesizer which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with sufficient voice quality . with &amp; t@@ ts ; you can neither adjust pitch , volume nor speech speed with this voice syn@@ thesizer .
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , locate Fl@@ ite as the first one on the CDs of your distribution .
H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer working with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into di@@ ph@@ ons and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice syn@@ thesizer generates the sound . the voice quality is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ mu@@ gr .
download at least one German voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame .

EP@@ OS is a free speech syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with sufficient voice quality . with &amp; t@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume with this voice syn@@ thesizer .
start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ OS T@@ TS voice syn@@ thesizer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card reader . in the input fields , enter additional parameters for the programs . type in an &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ian voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed .
the command module allows you to use and t@@ ts ; any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be shown . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Option Network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose from the list that best matches distribution and rel@@ a@@ as@@ est@@ and . by checking the non @-@ re @-@ promp@@ ting setting , the setting can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tabs :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... setting up the settings dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button will display the dialog with more options .
in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are carried out by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system startup , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the network mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on a switched off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking Interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address like about 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution machine part of the Rei@@ ters name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Hin@@ auf or Her@@ under in priority .
by clicking the Add ... from the group Computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the Add Name Server dialog will be displayed .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group Computer to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... This dialog will display the Edit dialog .
the list of known machines describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list of named hosts contains some entries , which support and ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple ali@@ ases , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog named Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical user interface such as k@@ package or the install tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended by experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 5 is expected to be implemented in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the point of contact with a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used .
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a space reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for specific things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the second one lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the net address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed loop .
this section contains the configuration files written by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which in addition offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective package . the second purpose was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ trains the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; does not know the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked whether the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been included . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the fold of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band by &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
one type of tape must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the band from &amp; k@@ dat . floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity , the band continues with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been opened , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
when you have confirmed the settings , the Backup dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will check . this dialog displays the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before initi@@ ating the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the recovery settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape index file using the contents of the tape . this process removes all existing index files for that tape . you can re@@ create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of the files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all the folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up which are on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file system .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this will cause all the files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , conve@@ ys &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat tries to lock the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . this setting may not work for all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , if &amp; k@@ dat is released , the tape will be automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for floppy sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat tries to change the hardware @-@ side block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case report the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the time the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , it allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the screen@@ shot below , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start attempts , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will open . it will not appear to you , and instead it opens a small message window , so you have not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files usually don &apos;t find themselves under Linux in the folder / var / log , usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or string . to do so , enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a log file will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can of course also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then only calibr@@ ated with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the Protocol File System Protocol , select the process column , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , thus show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the log lines sent or created by that process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than log lines of level hint . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can display the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines from the main window &apos;s context menu to display all the new log lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has an own web page on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. This location provides you with more current information on the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; node ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it System is rapidly becoming a standard for the control of the program start @-@ up during startup of the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service that you want to boot when you boot the system or when changing to another run level . system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls are based on r@@ c.@@ local .
for example , r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you need it . most of the systems have this file , even if there is not much use to it . you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to execute something with the serial port when you boot .
the kernel searches for the program in different places and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ Level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial area :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ Level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then get it repaired by re@@ starting the system and running the following :
but how does all the right scripts start ? if you type -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name and if the one contains a K , the script is called up with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ 2 or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original runner level ( or its position ) . this only happens when you pull out an entry in the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . in order to just copy them to a new Run@@ Level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously been in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ Level 1 Start , Run@@ Level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired Run@@ Level with Pa@@ ste ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by re@@ pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine is constantly re @-@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ Level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ Level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just quit when their configuration files are not available or in@@ correctly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read Chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you can use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two tabs , the user name and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it will display the User or Group properties dialog .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users is a map card on which you can make individual settings . more flash@@ cards appear , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the Password Management tab appears , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card reader only appears if for at least one built @-@ in file system constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limitation of space in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space restriction .
the Groups tab informs about the group assignments of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user on the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the li@@ lo boat manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to bo@@ oting the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
