<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & konqueror; translate menu on Tools Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated in place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations don't make any important decisions dependent on the translation without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual of & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Setup extensions.... Open the map tool and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the package node; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror; before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has crashed & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called Folder Filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools Insight filters. you can filter & konqueror with the module; you can filter the current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentelement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView is that nested folder hierarchies can be displayed graphically with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily recognized, can be easily detected when viewed at the bottom of the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can be either depth for easy recognition of the shading depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby the display errors occur due to the sign of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With display algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. parameters are drawn to indicate the nesting of the entries, and this framework needs space, which then is no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. it is always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry above the menu item View View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Image Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; - Menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the image gallery module, a dialog opens, allowing you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the File Name box of the image you specify whether the file names are displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the checkbox File size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size checkbox, specify whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is saved and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In file selection, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the Subfolder check box, you can set up a scroll bar or turn field to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Use the original images to copy original images to see if the original images should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the check box use comment file you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box you can specify a color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following web browser behavior can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Window Navigation Pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change the browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to access via the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are correctly represented by the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry Add... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module, check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digi.More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& Edit; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& Edit; try to make reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these shortcuts, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& Edit; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; if you are a regular user of & digikam; you can ask here questions to other users of & digikam; in this mailinglist, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; website to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam; to participate, registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions for login in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & Edit; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder here. just enter path names or click the folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & Edit; will you additionally use as an alame library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & Edit; looks every subfolder as an album. no image is changed. during browsing the folders you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& Edit; thirst recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it is in hidden folder. this lets you insert exceptional and digitized; do this by inserting a dot in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo out of the album and using this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & Edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keywords to manage your photos in albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, then Edit & Edit; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with raw files is described in the Roh Decodersettings and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digi.More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device.</seg>
<seg id="75">& Edit; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and broadcasts are slow over the serial port, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably readout the thumbnails of digitiphoto2. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digikam; is how easy it is to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, and digitized; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes to & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put a picture in another part of the alame tree, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that one image can't be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed at present in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name only works if this is indicated as a symbol view. which fields can be displayed you can configure in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos managed by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the disk, after the name of their collection in the alname properties or the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. to do so, select Import Pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to include information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos if you want to sort or delete albums from the tool list. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the Settings for Collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Eldest, average, New Year's buttons: these set the date on one of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & Edit; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you have to click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& Edit; supports entering keywords for single photos in the My Keyword List at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the pictures in this album will be displayed in the frame window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a while while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the respective preview. what information this is, you can change settings digitized; select the Albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to suit your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you want to let the mouse-cursor rest for a moment over a picture, the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that comes with & digikam; works. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that come with & digi.You can choose between viewing the pictures, a slideshow or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F4 Picture Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit.... in the Edit section; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & Edit; the functionality you need is not provided. you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the Open menu. to do this, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image. by doing so, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& Edit; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to right click the preview and select Rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you have the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & Edit; delete it into the trash bin from & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del. if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My date list; organize your photos based on the data. & Edit; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change to the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My Keyword listequot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so, you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when & digikam; the pictures will be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keywords; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and putting it down there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selected in the context menu keyword. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click on the image with the right mouse button and select Add as an album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use this functionality with keywords, first you have to provide your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag and drop them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords; alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumbnails of the images and select cue points from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear in the main window when you preview the picture.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Keyword menu. the menu displays only the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view displays a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved by this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box, which indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click on it, the filter is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be executed. the results will be displayed in the View list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option from its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search, the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select Expanded Search, the dialog for Advanced Search will appear to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search. see the tool for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu Search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules will be added by operators separated, or deleted. each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or at least... You can create Search of the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they meet. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one. by using a sponge, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you move a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then this will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. here, too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can scroll in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this of course assumes that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& Edit; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens. if you are back in & Edit; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and drop it there. a small arrow will show you which copy in which window pane is to be seen. if you want to synchronize thumbnails from the toolbar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images, then these are also carried out with the other image. you can thus compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sorting out of a series of images. if you navigate pairs from the toolbar, then the first two pictures are automatically loaded into the sections to be compared. use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal extinguishing operations also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it e.g. easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can recognize on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; then both pictures will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom works as well as in other views. just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan, and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect, and use your images. we focus on the process for digital photographers that & digikam; we focus on downloading, renaming, sorting, converting, grouping, backing, viewing, scanning, archiving, maintenance, and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes up, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data, which provides information on or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't need to find a certain photo without inventory administration. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use definitely not & digikam;. the approach to save the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees a very fast search and a secure archiving to which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether other access to your photos should have, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in the same location several times in one year. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that you save the metadata option in the Edit Settings page in & Edit; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? to do so, Edit & Edit; provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work starts, because you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now continue with keywords, keywords, as you can often refer to other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source with embedded keywords, then Edit & Edit; automatically mount the tree for you or insert the images in the correct place. resorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub-tree on another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overlap. this is a very rough representation because every block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer to it, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that this is the landing place of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. wow! you begin to dream associations, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help Him over the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & Edit; you can save as much text as you want, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8). you can even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checker. if you export your pictures to web galleries, then these labels will not tell the story a second time for the publishing.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will become deeper in the future. I am sure one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographic details. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this can be titles like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note on the author field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the image to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread aberration</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, those cautious must be handled and you may not get trusted for more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which seems to be a miracle for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; however, it is not available for Macs. there are similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the media with a description, date & author marks and then store at a clean, dark dry and protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides on this subject a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: discos are the longest if you are operated at temperatures ranging from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reason is that SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART indicate the imminent failure. this is especially read errors and publisher counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account for much, this is different with devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause severe keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, as these also feature a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a few seconds failure can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and shut down the system. if you buy an UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of power failure with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services rendered to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version will provide you more, in case of Flickr more dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies the offer contains a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these disorders remain undetected until one day you should open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss for notebooks and 46% in the workplace systems. for notebooks, the percentage of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most think. it leads to less damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 stop settings from fundamental physical borders. this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">So you get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anybody else responsible for data loss. therefore, make your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the re-installation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft misfortunes: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above, a common reason for data loss is panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Full backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two times: that of the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental Backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. create multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes to a compression system closest to the exception that is only scanned and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure gives you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC information stored in the image file, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseeable due to your nature, you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re-assess as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to forego a certain alertness. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so, if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability and the area you want to expand on a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc # source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sdc # change the size of the disk if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store Gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open crude image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers now provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the resource block quot; technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP will fit as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider using DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures on the camera edium are, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine layer editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & Edit, then you should add the metadata again. under certain circumstances, these have been cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digikam; in the Adding video to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your legacy database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. for some cameras, this may take a while. when the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that not all information is available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">Tab Metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam;. while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired ones with the default selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the Selected button is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not yet been downloaded by & Edit. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the All or Selected Download buttons, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the section My Albums tab. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have chosen the target album, press OK, and & Edit; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a & digikam album before you delete it from the camera. if you want to completely erase it from the camera, you should do so through the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos often not meaningful names. the file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you upload photos from different shooting sets to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was made.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The Options During the transfer, three more options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two will affect the data about the author in the Standard AutoriIdentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can e.g. use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. to do so, switch the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name option, you have the possibility to change the file names in lowercase. or uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings to rename are saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& Edit; can use all the information about the camera's orientation at the time point recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not supply this information, & digikam; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made, it can & Edit; use this to automatically create sub-albums in the target album when downloading. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data bar, you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you will need to turn on this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the Date-based bottom at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their machine to their camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & node; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, question & digikam; you where the pictures should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position specified in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. the data can be identified by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can use one click to open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that Siemens v2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the direction, saddle and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-editing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and last via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic allocation.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy co-ordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Edit; try to give as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to set up the Edit menu; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; set if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also during database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for author line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this can be names like e.g. hired photographer, freelance photographer or an independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC rims. this means that the metadata is permanently in the image and not only in the Edit Database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & Edit without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labeling as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read from other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer hangs over a file in the main window. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; Edit; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types and digikam; try, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions from & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminated table by & digikam can be set to the default values on this page. however, each time you open the illuminated table, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you are using the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the picture. these colors are defined here. in image editing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that image data requires more time to expand and pack. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF files option can be used to compress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the ability to save loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digikam; the image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. at present it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. this dialog allows you to change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid patterns with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned into, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed light, as a continuous white. use the setting of continuous white in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the Edit & Edit Image options. to keep the time for the demo session small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-invoicing algorithm is a digital image process in order to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data, which comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like that. VNG Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenization Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it produces color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grazing, since you are performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from a color space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviors If a picture is opened in image processing / ink management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Sets the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles. & Edit; examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility & quot; standard source; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when you open the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The ink management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like e.g. Canon, which do not include color mapping or gammacorrection. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to perform the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what is intended for. unfortunately, not with Canon models. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portraits and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be downloaded by & Edit; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the Preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information about KIPI modules, please use the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">Slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand side show a list of all supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic Detection that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the picture-display mode. below there are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire-mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify here the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / h, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & Edit; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can show the conversation of & digikam; set a photo in an album while deleting a photo. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be applied silently by & Edit; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you will need to save the changes using the Change button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also set the display of the Welcome screen from & Edit; tie at startup. this speeds up the start process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Enm Start search for new photos constraint & Edit; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & Edit; you decide if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & Edit; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the tool bar under Settings Design. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the Preview and selecting the My Display / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & Edit; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting up the section image editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifier and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save As.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or the button The Restore image editing button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image editing action can be undundated or restored. the last action can be undone by modifying or rerestoring working from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should check the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z, and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; click the return button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out into the photo by using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically choose magnifier</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you will come to the normal view where you use the Esc key. normally, the tool bar will be displayed. if you do not want this, you can change it in the Edit menu; Edit main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the default & node; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences. all image projections can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Print Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always performed when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword review shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously applied in this & digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word. you can thus quickly limit the number of options in search for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification in the input of keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, it will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their Album, - Date, Keyword and Search views. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears that prompts you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and have created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search using all the items in the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the Group button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why didn't Picasaweb or Flickr be listed? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information on color management. additionally, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by email or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use a different color space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to sound my monitor when I decided to work in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB means that your monitor is set to sRGB. if you are working as sRGB, you must either install your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalization, balance, automatic balancing and contrast extend from the Corducer Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminosity factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the balance achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and realising all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a little limited because it has a color space of 8-bit per color. if you are too far away from the original image, areas can occur with overexposure. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Colors White Balance of the Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as the vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right there is a histogram that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is shown as a pure indicator in the preview and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color value correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provides you with four color effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently reversed the development of the picture. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to fine-tune this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically feasible. another upliftment eventually creates a negative image that does not produce photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that works on (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">The tool tone correction is based on the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of sliders for the application described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three sliders are clicked into and that can be shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controls and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is often the most useful. in images, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpette can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two knobs that can be used to change the output values as interactive as in the input values. for example, the output values can be used to create a background image as background while something else is to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the preset values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright notes, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">If you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if found in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance channel. shade and sun shades were set with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Edit channel mixer; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color nuances of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controller for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to save luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the option monochrome, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color. colour space consists of small room artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. preserving the option Luminance is enabled. the original image can be seen in (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and enhances the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and middle tones as he adds a bit cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the fate of a pressure and the redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & Edit; apply Tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the Edit menu; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to retain his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. throughout the picture, it surrounds it with a colored line, Niepce transforms it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bottled it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. width ranges from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you used the tool according to the aspect ratio previously used.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image in any position. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & Edit; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Tools menu can be used in image editing to create templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam; mail list digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button reduces the image underneath. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically adjust the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& Edit; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process requires colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in blurred edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more afterward sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera has often been used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness while reading the image. if you disable it, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the sharpening tool. this can be done using the Corducer Focus menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful about this because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is refocusing the tool. you can refocus it via the menu entry Correct. under refocussing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool to sharpen softness with the Corducer softness menu entry and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. this sets the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined with it for an edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharpen and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image that (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The Edit & Edit; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted resolution filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to focus an image & quot; refocusing quot; in which it reverses the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blur mask. refocus mostly achieves better results as blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'sche fold. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixels. in most cases the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter if your blur is hot. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave uncomfortable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Maskieren produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the blurring Maskieren uses a bigger neighborhood than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masks must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blurring. for the Wiener Filter, it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color image has to be corrected. this image has been made using an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the correction of sharpness in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The controller smoothness of the area has been darkened so as to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows for a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine-tune the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines relative smoothing. therefore, set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothing. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since then it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 suffices.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors with small artefacts will be corrected. the module is used in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip. the original image is to be seen under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smashing smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the field of sharpness. this value sets the distance between the filters forwards to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: check the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically more ruffled. however, it also lubricates the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter may appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier to sharpen than a picture. use the tool to sharpen soft marks with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. the texture replacement is performed with a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some ranges even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are to be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can interrupt the calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with uniformity noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious picture on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly with high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels that will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a colour photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure times. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The Edit; Vignetting Correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead, vignettierquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the lens filter, which increases the necessary shutter time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should, even with center filters, use an opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's Filmenund of the color and grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image without the filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three other exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light strength absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly at a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density by a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, because you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original picture (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminous and contrast correction was also carried out with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but throws off at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the thickness of distortion second count. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth count. this value appears more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'vertices' has the reverse mark of the parameter in general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value will scale the image size and result in a correction of the first degree. negative values enlarge while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best carry out this correction as the first. if you want to reap a picture and then perform a tonal correction the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the ton- / kissenoidal distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the Transforming Cutter from image editing or the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tone-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some images, such as shots from the front, frame and picture, is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tone-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web site which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). add the Add movie grain option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos since colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter movie grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix great silver particles of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-graining effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere loosened from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO 2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the movie gradation effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with (1) and the machined part is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and Gläse17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline yourself.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter Gravity shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped into wax. it uses an copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engravings is a fast tool to recreate your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyright-protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects take long time to compute and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyright-protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Blurring: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographed from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurred the image softly in the dark and strongly in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness of sharpness: blurring the image by a random shift of the pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and blurred them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this makes it natural for your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the Edit; Edit an area free of raindrops. to do this, use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or turning it. you can find the tools in the menu Transforming Turning or Transforming Spiders.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the Cbeg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. to do this, select Transform Size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothing. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. each setting for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and drag a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blowing by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. image editing allows you to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by moving at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button Der Zuclide button of image editing in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save File Save or File Save entries in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Trimming the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool according to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trimming tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settling assistance settings allow you to hide help, so that you can put together your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-level rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden split is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden split in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of its two preceding figures. the divider divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will give you good results for your shots to achieve your goal. compared to the third-level rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangle is used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that directs the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirroring and vertical mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy for you to hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the objects are rotated by an angle. you can fix this with the Edit; Edit and the tool free rotation. choose Transforming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are shown in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function Transforming Cutting from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left at the top: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Corner left below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you will receive unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with Transforming Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction. for example, a horizontal shot will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shearching your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can drag horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the Schilling Tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shot, this effect is usually negligible, but two shuttering is twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot, the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Edit; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give here a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& Edit; displays only files in formats that you know. this happens based on file extension and a comparison of those with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file in image editing will be displayed. you can change this list of file extensions the & digikam; you can find more information in the section configuration.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images. in doing so, redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphiViewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & node program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphicalviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphics; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphicalviewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & node; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI;. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; re-calculates the graph and displays in & kgraphicalviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraph viewer; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from around 1000 knot and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & kgraphiViewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; -Tool & dot; for the representation of the graph. required are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphicalviewer; without launching an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file open and the (empty) list Last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the screenshot below:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview from the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded in & kgraphiviewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphiViewer; can also note your decision so that later on. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraphicalViewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphene file outside a running & kgraphicalViewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphicalviewer; instance or want to present the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether or not the parts of the graph come to a page to be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphene without header and with a different font</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send your photos to people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, show the photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export module to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. thus, it is used for your authentication. thus, it is your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can register for Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login the module can send photos to the Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the Export module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog showing the current access permissions that the module displays. at present, the module does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should once be pressed after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos starts to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words separated by comma. these will be added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>

<seg id="805">If you select the Change option to select the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value given in maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Galerie-Export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The geographic location of the KIPI allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image's metadata. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to perform a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the time zone must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and the camera. if the deviation is below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a location for images you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a series of photos at the same location. since the dialog moves the coordinates from a call to the next, you only have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and reset with the displayed map. choose the region in question and zoom in again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the selection tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you will not need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the album preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the overall look and layout for each page. the option For each image creates a page created a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page opens in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Dextershow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all its associated images. choose a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth setting you can change the default color depth, which naturally influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as twisting, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual losses of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases, since no compression of the color information takes place. for example, this can be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Module Digital Camera Client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then, select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the destination image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at lev2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoders module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file in the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can use the encoding button to start the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go fast or in all rest a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that coding or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages via the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve you or print out the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently or later to use them elsewhere, you shouldn't choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the convert program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the Starcode and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can reduce or increase the image. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures window will be shown with the images you have selected. you can add additional images via the button images using a file selection dialog. for the last image selected you will see a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Remove Images the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are already attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format in the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted in lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions about how to display your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have an appropriate graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the file name of the images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. afterwards, you can cancel it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose to show that the images are displayed in a random order. so the order of the pictures is not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual pictures can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show the presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, every transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can play with & kphotoalbum; through these browsers, see the picture. as you can see by comparing with the picture, there are now in each group, so in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click with the mouse on the entry Persons, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images shown on which both persons can be seen. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name. you can use a & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own preview image, which is of course also true for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, please select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must define yourself which image to be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you will need to select the image view window (described in more detail) and display the Add Categories Editor in the context menu. now you can customize the image for the respective person. in the View window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the Label or Description field, the captions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched for; the date can be either part of the total date, i.e., 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are mapped.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather like to try functionality, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry Cphotoalbum; -Demo. then, some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a cohesive HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time line can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time line can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries view view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of that date will appear in the preview pane) and in addition, the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, in the preview view only pictures of that period are displayed. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described; integrated version that you can create through the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Target. in the following, each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description to contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page. additional information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer even without description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all pictures are exported. you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. therefore, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 does not have to download any images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transfer time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started after the pages have been created. otherwise, the URL you specify here should be the folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them there. thus, the import function, see, properly works you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that have just been described have related all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., you need to do with & kphotoalbum; do not even make this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are imported into and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file, or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that you can share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images you can call through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manual option near the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are standard Zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu file, select & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import into which folder you want to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category of persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named for your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to import are to be imported and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. for example, if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the different steps of (1) determining the information about your images, over (2) searching and viewing, through to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top file of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your pictures are saved and automatically restores it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; using the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; setup... enter a window to change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will learn the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can click on the F1 key by pressing a button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places, and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete members' groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; its modular system shares with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plug-in Interface. additional information can be found on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules menu. the modules cannot and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most of the modules have a help page, which you can call through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum have been tested only very little. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. demo database you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use with KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are arranging their pictures into albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates order after albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album has to be released & kphotoalbum; the modules are also presented with a list of albums. here's a & kphotoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category individuals, you will do & kphotoalbum; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass on this to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to by any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain much information as you have not yet entered any information about your images. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to mark any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each picture either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by specifying people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be mapped, you can, by means of the names used up, to find the persons quicker and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add notes to them. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are located below the thumbnail on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. also, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and store it in order to make it an subcategory of this entry. caution, this assumes that you are currently sorting your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window from a frame by pulling it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... that offers you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or of all the pictures if you don't have a filter. for example, you can see the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Delete button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; i.e., use pictures without you being saved on the hard drive. of course you need to have the images stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right upper corner is truncated, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy and copy files from folders. & kphotoalbum; do not yet support you to insert the respective CD. therefore, if you want to avoid trouble, how to avoid messing up your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Image menu you will find a submenu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you can filter the images in such a way that at the end are those that you want to make for others inaccessible and click to lock all the pictures that your little sister may see, control and lock the menu entry Anything out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set the pictures to be hidden in case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry to lock images, so that all the pictures you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply choose password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to deny the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. it of course shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the top part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to this display. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slides. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and out into the image. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. using the Minus button, you can zoom in again The Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the function key, the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that come in and out with the plus and minus key are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view it Cancel and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to mark the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to create pictures with features while you look at them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. see a picture in which the attributes A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available to you in your browser. so if you want to edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add all the images at once with annotations. this is described in. then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make straight.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to view categories in the Insight view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image has been selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will allow you & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painting later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to disable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the image on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">In order to be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object already selected, as all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry from the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click Preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the whole texture will be rendered, even if you want to render only one part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window layout or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag it to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the Begasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the Begasser in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the Begasser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the infestation bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the infantile bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window order... saving it. a dialog will appear where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon icon in the toolbar or select the View Scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a fast preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Save modes from the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can type any name, but it makes sense to have a name that lets you know the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the chart map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop down selector you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. the standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling includes the adjacent pixels. recursively, because each pixel is distributed again and again, because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray uses a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values of the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 is computed with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this tab card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly completed, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; to import the scene, select Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the complete command range of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. click here the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced Projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approximation for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a bottom is rendered below the objects. the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window instructions will explain how you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Existing window classifications shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">New column lets you create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with unts you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating, the view does not anchor in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result, you only receive a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. when you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the User Documentation to & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the Apply button or press the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a box (insert final body boxes) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; indeed offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the plane, although at the moment only as a finite finite plane. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you view the object tree carefully, you will find that you can unfold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select First subobject. the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = soil pigment), with a click on the Preview button see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities again, but take the simplest now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, then click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. you will need to enter two new attributes in the color list. select the color list in the object tree. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the checkboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be easy to execute, since you should have understood the basic principles of & kpovmodeler. the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button), the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise the sphere would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in Sphere Pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The shine effect and reflection settings already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if Metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu, replacing the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saved saving will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. you can only select this menu item if you have previously used Edit.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add new commands with this option for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set the toolbars. with this option you can add and remove toolbars for & kpovmodeler; command and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give color to the surface of an object color on a pixel basis by applying a image file as a colour chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& Dextershow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & Dextershow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can click on & LMBN; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if any image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first characters of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In Dialogue Configuration - & Dextershow; there are five cards. in three of them, General and Editing and Slide Show, you can set the working method of & Dextershow; in the other two, shortcuts for the display window and shortcuts for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the pictures will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can adjust further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point activates, loads & cube show; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuicko; when you exit the name of the last opened folder. at the next start, open & tap show; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this will be used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is bigger than the image, the background will be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & Dextershow; set up only a few of the file types that the program can display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option enlarges the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is enabled as default.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The Amarok DCOP interface has many general functions that can mostly be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options from Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog, so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. this is usually called exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure specifies the script to display the setup dialog. to store and load the setup data each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok places the working folder on the folder where all the data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signaling that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions to query more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to add an entry to the menu, you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to work, for example, clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as myskript.amaroscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the generalization amaroscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the -p parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the features and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we wrote a small guide on how to compress kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedeskant.org. Gnome will work, for example, trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag library library. you can locate the file using ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if for example & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate automatically when inactive for... to setting the sound system, or at least do not use any value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via email (the e-mail automatically opens during a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to the fact that many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-infos, but do not identify them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($mp3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "errors when writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag; amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amaroapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amaroapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf in such a way that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems are resolved easily by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio at the same time. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">It does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would just hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>

<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Drivers. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for analyzers), or decrease the size of the Arts Buffer in the Control Center and Sound & Multimedia, Sound System. the smaller the buffer, the less active the visualizations react. yes, this is an error, please help us to fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; why?</seg>

<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok first!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files once as system administrator and once as your normal user. delete all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the most recent-config / GStreamer-config) and run start & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1293">OK, the player window and the playlist have tricky features, but what about the symbol in the system section of the Control Panel?</seg>
<seg id="1294">In the context menu, you can select which browser to display.</seg>
<seg id="1295">My Personal Folder $HOME is located on a NFS drive. after the start of Amarok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The internal SQLite database of & Amarok; does not work with NFS. either you need to link ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok to a local drive, or use Amaroks MySQL support.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Insert the CD, then click Play Audio CD in the menu. it opens a file browser with multiple folders. for normal read, switch to the wav folder, select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Konqueror window. for automatic encoding, use files from the folders mp3 or ogg instead.</seg>
<seg id="1298">QStringList values = query ("SELECT playcounter, createdate," FROM statistics "" WHERE url = '% 1'; ") .arg (escapeString (url)));</seg>
<seg id="1299">Basically, this adjusts the previous evaluation with a decreasing value based on how often the play was played. the more often the play was played, the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result.</seg>

<seg id="1308">If you want to use ALSA, please use the latest version available. old ALSA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Probably & Amarok; compiled before you have installed xine or GStreamer. therefore, the. / configure routine did not compile these output modules. you need & Amarok; reconfigure and install.</seg>
<seg id="1310">Now I & Amarok; re-installed, but the output modules still do not appear. and now?</seg>
<seg id="1311">Probably you will use a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program. although GStreamer is installed, the necessary developer files are missing. the same also applies to xine, you need to install xine-devel. after that, you need to recompile and install Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1312">I receive the bug GStreamer-CRITICAL * *: factory for 'Adder' has no type.. How can I fix this?</seg>
<seg id="1313">Your version of GStreamer was compiled with Prelinking, which is incompatible with GStreamer. you need to compile GStreamer without Prelinking. a tip by merlin-tc: use no LDFLAGS if you compile Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1314">I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file's mimetype audia / mp4, although the module GStreamer faad is installed.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok control center. at the top of the window, there is a runtime display that displays the currently running piece or current stream. just below is the area, the game time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired play time for the remaining time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the runtext display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also available under the running context display. the PLPL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set Equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece's position or volume. using the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 default settings, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that there is in no other player. however, don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The Playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use, yet powerful enough even for advanced users.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three sub-windows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the sub-window has fallen off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the Statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to recreate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the Cover Administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played right away.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces from this interpreter. this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the tracks in the individual sections to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the item or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the Text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click the text subwindow, try and Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is yet running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit Button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be saved in & Amarok's collection database. no running text script is required for this.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com according to the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - In addition, the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below there will be a further division after the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under Different Interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sorts by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All the albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Group Genre / Interpret - Your tracks are displayed first by genre and among them sorted by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Group Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works as well as the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically reappend your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view and in the tree view. notes on using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box, which allows you to filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose various time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. furthermore, you can of course also select your total collection, whereby the filter is practically disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This feature inserts the selected pieces into queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Broadcast Media Player - Add the pieces in the queue to the media player. see the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned as either a data or an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, select the selected album as a compilation, and it will appear among various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Pick up a compilation marker - Change an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. the album will then no longer be shown under various performers but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes Intelligent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlist browser includes the smart playlists. these use & Amarok's built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click to Add Intelligent Playlists to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired tracks from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive integration for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because all files that do not match your search criteria are hidden in the file list.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter, you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the mounting of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropping files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping. once you enter there characters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter wildcards separate search terms, & Amarok will search for entries containing all search terms. if you enter, for example, one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two, and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type OR between the search terms OR, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then complete the search term with goose bumps: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not after entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries of entries by pressing the Ctrl key and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some of the playlist features. on the left, you will find the Add button to which you can add the playlist to the playlist. to the right, you will find playlists, empty playlists, and shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, larger analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window on the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, playback controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up Toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for the playback position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the Status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. over this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry will open the Visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start them by selecting Actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>

<seg id="1445">OGG Vorbis Library: OGG Vorbis is a completely open, patent-free and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio data streams. OGG Vorbis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3. this library is used by the Ogg Vorbis decoder and encoder modules.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Mad: this is a high quality MPEG-Audio decoder. it currently supports MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG 2.5. all three audio layers Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (e.g. MP3) are fully supported. this library is used by the MP3 decoder module.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Normalize: this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level. this can be useful e.g. for creating a mixed CD's and Mp3 collections; without normalize, the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces will play differently loudly.</seg>
<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way to recharge recently opened projects. the associated sub-menu contains a list of these projects. one click on one entry will open the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. once the project has been saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project has been modified and not yet saved, ask & k3b; after what is to happen. you can then discard between saving and changes. furthermore, you can interrupt the closing and keep the project open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Closes all open projects. & k3b; will ask for any unsaved project, which is to happen, just as if you had called for each project file Close.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all open projects and terminates & k3b;. for each unsaved project, you will be asked what to do, as if you called the Close file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog. it has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the files to be added appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">This dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, which causes & k3b; to burn the medium, the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described by the What is that? help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you create files for a multiple session CD. the data of the previous session are always included even if this function is not used. it is more likely to be used as help for you to view the files and folders already present on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This record only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD project. this function causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes no files from the medium, it only deletes the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD copy dialog. this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a CD, which you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image of a DVD, which you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. converting / diminishing a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not yet necessary, so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the total (video) data of the source media in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), which will completely erase the contents. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes Overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (neros * .nrg files are currently not supported but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a source of data, which can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A DVD video that has previously been loaded can be converted. this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used standalone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings and even options to change the size and to cut black borders.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view is switched on or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow section that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part, you can adjust the key mapping for this further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so when you start the wizard you have to set the password for the system administrator (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens & k3b settings; general application settings can be made here. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the DCOP, you can use either the dcop command line program or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task will be more important, which of the included programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the dcop command line program. to be able to use the dcop command line, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions common all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void createDataDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void format Dvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (CURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void addurl (Qstring name, QString parent) void addurls (KURL url, QString parent) void addurls (Qstring path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / trueg / summer efile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio creator; is an audio CD; a reader for & kde;. with it you can easily record audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and supported by many encoding encoders. currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into MP3 or OGG format or also other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything themselves. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audio creator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not handle the protection, it is not possible to bypass a protected audio CD; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of reading a & CD; explained on the hard drive. this (hopefully) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the page step by step example you will find more information how this program is used as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. note that before the encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected for encoding instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pipses) for programming events (such as reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main Setup dialog from & kaudioCreator; with different cards (like Encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">MP3 and OGG are the most common among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate differences are less important, since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. requires less than 256 kbps for complex and less complex tracks of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car poster systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset InSane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from freedb over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand-commit / used with & audio creator; and the coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -t of lame and the title parameter of & kaudio creator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the hosts themselves. it is to be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (translation of the translator: this is meant by the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released publicly available on CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio creator; is active a check box to choose (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address defined in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator; used to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the update of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used for this purpose; if you want to know more exactly, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the right distribution first if it hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) to the encoding of the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined encoders. more information about the encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read bar on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to produce MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, since it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it (eg by trying to copy something into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set up of & audio creator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is intended where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freedb to download the freedb to download the data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them at each reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your device. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if you can access the drive with other programs, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. there's not much to do here. here an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incomplete information, so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The carton card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download over the internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, it is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, the two selector fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this path, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but since many firewalls buck the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more Happiness with protocol 80, as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces at the same time: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">"" "CD; after reading out the last piece:" "" "check" "" "to check out the CD; to discard at the end of the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this, the path / folder must be specified where the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another disk. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if wished. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to code more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set of & audio creator; finished. this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was written and furnished in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is built, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will be collected. the process described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; use which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from that for a & CD; with successfully logged data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually insert data instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, search for help in the section Questions and Answers or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the CD is successfully fetched from the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there, a window will be displayed, and you can select the database entry that best fits your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you did not select the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; Settings dialog for Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Current Title' input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments mally per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of the data from freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot below. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & audio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the created files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the selected CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not provide the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All items button on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection of the selection process started, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the jobs and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Orders to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first item is currently scanned onto the hard disk. the status of the program will be shown in the lower left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is encoding of pcs 1 into the format MP3. thus, reading and coding are parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in the case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudio creator; will maintain CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package today. however, if you are familiar with CVS, you can already download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions already include a pre-compiled package, as & kaudio creator; install the kdemultimedia package from your distribution. if you read this, you've probably already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many options. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different tabs of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any indication as to proceed from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of program start), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a handbook on & kaudio creator; may it be done. at least after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to get the source file from the & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke game from & kde;. in addition to others, it also features real-time graphics and karaoke real time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. Alsa is involved as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the track.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop to drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you end & kde; during playing a song, kmid will start again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it will display the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the Play from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts once you pull it to the & kmid; window. (with multiple pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and passing the regulator back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display to change the playback speed. to restore the original speed, double click on the tempo LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry interval in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song lyric event and again other both. some pieces don't have any text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you do not have to manually adjust it. so, when you activate the automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text is automatically selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the text events or properties from the Settings menu. the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you compose. these are played in the series. in this section is how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu collection under the item Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the selected items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. consider this if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When an automatic addition to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when a piece is opened. the collection will then be added to the pieces that are to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu Order sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next song button, select next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Preferences item, the entry Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it doesn't matter since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the occurrences of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need any MIDI map because all GM sound cards are compatible (incl. Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all required translations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except for the Keymap section, which may appear as many times as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different TextID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches from General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all tones that this instrument needs to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun. to do so, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound is another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc.) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 listings.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sound on the percussion channel. see the accompanying Keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channels, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name Name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that there are no decimal quotes in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM presets that a keyboard that receives a pitch Bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to play a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which tones are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select View from the View Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, and so on. thus, the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection previously. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & cons; - Desktop open & konqueror; - windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just change to & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, switch to the automatic addition to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the Automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.midand create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. I'm trying to take some time for my hobbies.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arracis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You are really looking forward to sending me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count amongst friends of & kmid; however, before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get any money from anyone. I would like to stress that I only keep on programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch for AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid, can also be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you can also find links to pages with more karaoke songs, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have sound card, you need to compile & kmid; compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you obviously couldn't hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andckable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links from the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. if you are looking for an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the clicked record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & SMB Player; not running. simply click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and select next edit mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select from the File menu with Playlist and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or any other group will be selected without comparing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>

<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing during the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite shot: & lt; & lt; body; & lt; img dur = "incurrent" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; / lt;</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMVideoPlayer only can use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, therefore, it must include the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. under Unix-like systems, probably the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution. the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project includes some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for various distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the Kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly need to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the Kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions or if you compile, or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; Desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, & Kile; the possibility to complete, compile, post-process and troubleshooting within the source text as well as conversion and view tools for this. finally, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; -Reference and powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate;.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right expression: lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, a layie (inlay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While there is only a good view to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to be given. to be able to rule correctly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction to which the general characteristics like paper format, page numbering and text fields are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ 'documentclass, the body starts {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick-entry Assistant by & Kile; is a useful feature for speedy creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) provides some options for the creation of the document. there can also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this defines the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrbook], projector [projector], slides [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: the character encoding of the system should be set. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). they should always be used in the preparation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it's just a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you see greater areas of a green text on screen, it is with great probability that some mathematical environment was not closed. however, it is due to the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless. however, it will save you by highlighting time and costs.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environments, by entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {Command}) from & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for input of the text) and the corresponding line to define the command (e.g.\\ end {Command}). this function can be set up in the menu Settings... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into several elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when searching for a DVI; file [dependent file]], jumps & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -Viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; -Source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the loop search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; source code is jumped. as soon as you clicked on a section in the & latex; the source code is jumped to the appropriate place in DVI; viewers jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master Document: this function is used in working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the latex; source code will be compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no errors in source).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is used on the combination of the other and the other, and there is no call from & Okular; after the quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection boxes have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for quick classification of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other option is used to add items such as keywords, fuzzy notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified name (choice of a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is shown. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ MY is used for defining the font size. it enables the font sizes to be specified for the main text, the joints, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and specifying settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ Documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not fixed at the beginning, this can also occur later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the push button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document is missing, it should be sought in logging according to the errors. if it is used for quick construction & eyepiece; it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report is created with the font 12 and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow for the revision of the font size within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no description (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for the explanation of the readability and usability of the document. for example, there may be certain fonts, grease pressure, passive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is long until it is closed with a\ {end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be represented recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. quote begins with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit of text was entered, a few adjustments for better readability of the document should be made. to do this, make a quote, a few passages in the grease and passive pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be converted back to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a format-independent file format (engl. D e V ice I nr.). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, converting into desired other formats can begin by means of buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The ad search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers an appropriate setting for all & latex; bindings. to do this, simply set up Modern under Settings Kile... Tools Building to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To select the default search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on thumbnail. the jump to the corresponding position in DVI; the viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; - document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (setting up eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you do not open the & DVI connection, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be shown in the logging file or in the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the source code error source. in the editor you can use the Preferences LaTeX error and errors LaTeX error for jumps between errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the incorrect row, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the corresponding button is clicked on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-on users of and latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file may be opened or a new file will be created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard tags.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex; files are created in a simple way to create a template, and should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in menu tools directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; offers a very practical and latex; command reference which can be invoked over the MenÃ ¼ Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-clicking with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; meaning that in this way by clicking on\\ par\\\ par\\ bigskip only will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse and emphasize the various types of source texts. for example, the & latex; -Commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu items Edit jump marks or the corresponding key features allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this also highlights this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted at the first entry of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already offers excellent possibilities, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; Also added many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit options, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this expanded meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only preventive thing in & Kile is that the abuses are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word from the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning, as this command also reads & latex; commands with a swap character (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To allow a part of the document, the first one can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit removal, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition of a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to modify selected paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the command to opening the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to tune the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of nested environment commands, it is possible to get lost quickly. this command includes the most recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested welded groups parentheses can quickly get lost of the eye view. this command includes the most recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple application notes are used as gasses. for the appropriate implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple note signs. also for ending the application, the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and includes two complete connecting notes for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic addition of double application marks can be set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use foreign-specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and thus German or French application marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; enter key & box; enter an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), add & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, close & Kile; the current line with\\\\ including an adjacent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be set in Settings... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby arrange all the Et characters (amp;) among each other. if shift; Alt; amp; seek & Kile; after the next tabulator in the above line. although this tab is not possible to add, add & Kile; add some space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code completion, this was added in & Kile; in order to provide special commands (mostly for and latex;). it is built for different modes. three of them work on demand and the other two are fully configured for different modes...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {Environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {Surrounding} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and, as a result, the missing list can be cleared. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command. alternatively, from & Kile, jumping marks can be added, so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing jumping stamp NÃ ¤table jump mark and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; settings can be made to these lists. you can choose different wiper lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as shelves of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of the processing mode will result in a large list of surrounding commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the spacebar environment or key key Alt + Shift key Space key, the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient loss can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this has been done, the environment will be closed automatically. as soon as & Kile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of missing mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of settings that are immediately replaced by multiple strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... Kile can be set up. as an example of an abbreviation list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, contains the entry L =\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word complete mode introduced over the menu processing complete or key key Ctrl + Alt Space key, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large shelves are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many wishes in a document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written wishes.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu settings... Kile can be completely deactivated. here, the threshold value may also be specified for the display of the complete termination.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The data processing files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / Unit / Kile / complete / mode / contents of the Persian home folder. mode is available for Abbreviation, dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphic formats, the sections should be considered and considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as popular as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to see the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all tools are grouped in groups in the creation compiling, creating changes and creating a view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for observer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by the key key Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and can be seen using the old; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Installation command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the MenÃ ¼ Project New Project.... Here you will find the following information for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nick name of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and their own identity are important in terms of messages and annotations. see for more information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by recording the members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project. one example would be to record the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Small writing of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower attribution of attributes: uppercase / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Automatically close the optional tags: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, it will be inserted immediately after the date.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Automatically close non-optional tags: as above for all other tags except the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and end-tag automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic realization of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: expression types for recognition of different types of files. the default setting can be restored using the Default button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file open-open files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; regularly creates backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash, the document can be recovered from this backup when the program starts. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in a separate view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings to the next startup is useful when the user interface has been confused by modifying the MDI modes and andocking / dragging views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting shortcuts (a type of templates) that are unfolded when editing to more extensive text. shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause shortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plug-ins can be managed here. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third parties, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, at the best known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load a component in the "Only-Read" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-read KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, you can choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. (3) Debugger was adjusted, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that displays the contents of monitored variables. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug claims. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the View Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instruct the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution will continue. if a script is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include files are corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there weren't the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression is to be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value for a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing like folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag Folders carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better viewing and more information about working with them.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc can be edited for a file descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification.

<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... button. click New Action results in the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned key shortcut. by clicking on the user defined button, a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with Kone, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) which can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), be started. examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. for example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts local script folder: $PATH / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is appended to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be entered by & quantaplus; in the input field, you can specify what to send to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the exported application can also be rerouted. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, written to the standard error output. it can be specified, what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to specify actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the Tag has attributes and you are planning their use, enable dialog "Edit Tag," if available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graph More Software (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regards to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is & lt; startgt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some dividers. open the tool bar to set the dialog on Settings toolbar. make sure that the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the item to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this will add the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by trying to halve all the symbols to make sure everything is working.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = hfunc1.html func2 = hfunc2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # capability Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently on top of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but be proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places, there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) to send email, tool lists toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team considers them to be accurate and useful for publication. in order to make a thorough contribution, we recommend the resources to be signed, for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase will not be saved), or if you have several keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be cancelled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet of & quantaplus; it is supported to work by creating a DTEP package. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be necessary. there is the easier way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP packet.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that will appear in the! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to be able to understand them and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; used, available, and stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can personally use them.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; -Patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoges the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the tabs with information and the toolbars. please check in and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other, or all the tabs, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse cursor, help the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow for information about & quantaplus; to navigate, to open them and to roam. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done with the then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web page & etc. all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are usable only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking on the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as starting, editing, or sending an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, many attributes and namespaces can be changed. the content-oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -scripts executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not execute here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE desktop. & quantaplus; designed for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, extensible markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or execute help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and cared for by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, with the oldest entry being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. check the section on Templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when pasting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; capitalization that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and Switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Browse the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available modes of transport depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, managed the project. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project files / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set with actions... to be added. toolbars will be stored on toolbar toolbar, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of vision. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the upload of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; which you or someone else has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh entities from the DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without renewing the entire & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a submenu default in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">This only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of tools denied that this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">The plug-in menu lists the available plug-ins in the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who are using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; tidy using the external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changeover between the different types of the user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the quantaplus; main window respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that use the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the editor window's behavior. see & kate documentation for details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse pointer but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom, as, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.example) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the Profile subwindow or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible) that are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the selected debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile subwindow, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration dialog, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete actions. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the right mouse button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Different profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be blinded to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the main memory and forgotten in the end of the program. this option is useful if frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving feature or a danger. use them at your discretion. the password is hidden on the disk so that it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool bar, accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; the best way to design the toolbar. adding and adding is different. adding tool lists is treated below in the Adding tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, toolbar names or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog, where actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and setting settings actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory to the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents can be created in corresponding subfolders. it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can contain everything, from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template Save As Local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look under project templates in the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template saving selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view Templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: just copy the file to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dragging or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very goal-oriented approach. you can pre-type header lines and footers, or dynamically create with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the Templates subwindow is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / apps and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set up, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or re-identified templates for templates in this folder. this could be general header lines or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) using a complete command set for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor. then you can edit and revert to the source editor if necessary, where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document containing & PHP; a small green icon displays the Vohandaut of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit and PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that both the source editor and the VPL editor are visible and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor activated in sync. with pressing F9 this mode is activated, this mode is already active, puts the touch of the active cursor from one window to the other, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags in working with the VPL; editor is possible. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this is used to reduce the manual coding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. one click in the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is possible exactly as with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves as usual. text can be inserted through typing and deleting by button or distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way over the toolbars, as in the source editor. it is important to note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags does not remove, for example, if an anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Sheets Assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work, in this release, the tables or lists must be used tool lists.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To be able to compile successfully, except for libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present at a typical installation of & kde.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Hold in a template, at one point in a style- or xml file loaded by xsldbg or the current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, orphaned retaining points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg returns the complete path from a file name without path input. file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con xsldbg If a style sheet file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl is loaded, the following entry is possible:</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see exactly what was changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, many more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge the entire folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and compares the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more hassle if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ from files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are located in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Cdiff3 folder 1 folder folder folder 1 folder 2 folder folder 2 folder folder 1 folder 1 folder folder folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog displays your selection and displays it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merging folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C, a folder then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then begins immediately. in the Open dialog you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you can do nothing of & kdiff3; pull out. only dropping text in a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for this is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when comparing three files. this is to be seen in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an Info line with the output:, the filename and [Changing] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the jump to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. this group then becomes the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and may still choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and copy somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignore options or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly to the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the Paste button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the top of each group (as already explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / previous difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture downhill) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict. therefore, conflicts between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you will need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). if enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are stored according to the underlying OS. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the game and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; Setting up KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be represented. on these systems the button Preferences automatically adjusts an unregulated color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of whitespace characters will be inserted when the tabulator key is pressed. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual to the clipboard is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all the fully identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored. even when merging white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a cart return mark '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, while others only store a newline slot '\'. if this option is checked, carriage returns are made visible, but if this option is checked, this option will be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled by default. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is activated by default. it is effective for complex and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the section to scan folders and execute a merge. look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be added to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to & kdiff3; quit and restart so that the change becomes active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The encoding fields for encoding a short notice of what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit unicode, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn on this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after choosing A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will display a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply open the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the pop-up menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first transferred to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. you can use this function, for example, for cutting of annoying parts or for correcting indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line reconciliation to convert the input into uppercase: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all will follow the same pattern $keyword generated $\\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignore of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line reconciliation. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal pre-processor are maintained for displaying and merging. further operations change only the data that the newline algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processor, the line-like pre-processor will see the output of the normal processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in one folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... perform selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, then folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, uses & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window will inform you about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or using the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merging action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, colors red, green, yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. with folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchronize directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees only B as visible filename for the output file; copied & kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging (unsafe), then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after the other. it displays skill when merging is successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, then the C will be used as the target in the Three-Folder merge mode, B is chosen as the target and the A and / or B will be used as the target when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries could be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: choose directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to merge only the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid merge actions still exist by conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box will pop up with the Options, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select Start / Continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then, & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; crashes on a bug, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to try the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, you will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later merge of all entries. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered finished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (Set up menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be specified with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous point. marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3;) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed benefit will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the modification date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equally large. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action instead of merging. (this is considered insecure because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will receive the .orig. If an old backup file with the .org extension already exists, it will also be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of single files, not just the merge of entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folder merge view remains visible during the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can split the option directory & text window and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory -menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to merge the folder merge. to do so, use the current file merge from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory:</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes using the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then always a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the entitlements or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differencing viewer. to start KDE3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select InKDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, & kdiff3; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then removes & kdiff3; the name of the original file from the patch file. then, & kdiff3 starts; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview In - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; run as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now called Compare) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the diff3 program from the Diff-Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or want to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't give the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. by default, configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines to each other, this is the same, but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, it suddenly stops; No src has been left, and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have trouble compiling. should you still encounter difficulties, please report to the mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift removal) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift insertion) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">It will only show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the A, B and C buttons below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini-preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, finish them or move them. this works in both a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; displays all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries to set up pager... and exit. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager; however, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows inside the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager display; show the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is crossed together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st working desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs will be shown as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; appear in a 2xN grid, as is known from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical range, which is very well suited for presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch setup... the dialog settings will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign this value to it. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen motion. you can use & kmag; enlarge a part of the screen, as if you are reading a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for various users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of & kmag;.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like & kmag; launch, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following this window appears as a magnifying window. the image displayed in the magnifying pane is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default size & kmag; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magnifier. alternatively, you can & kmag; this causes a selected area of the screen in the magnification window (select window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the position of the mouse pointer. please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop down mode, you can customize the selection box to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifier window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifier window. this is also possible with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key, or push the & MMB, you can postpone the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop updating the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer persevere for a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive Strain Injury syndrome) and that any mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer persevere for a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people who suffer from the repetitive strain in Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse-click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from the bare moving of the mouse pain. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that causes pain when you click with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic relief aids: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you pause the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is enabled, & kmousetool; a pause after it has emulated the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click brings out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligentes is switched on, the shooting time is active (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button wait before it release the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back guides a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and select the General tab. there is a slider control sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; start. this feature is currently only available in & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. once you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the standby after clicking Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be turned off first. if you then have become used to automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it might be necessary to change the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of what position a mouse-click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not link leads to unintentional reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. but it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started a move, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by letting the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can even run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try and kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. this way you can no longer cause the mouse clicks to cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard and insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select the text by clicking a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button clicks a sound like a mouse click plays. so you know exactly when the move time starts with the smart moving. later, you can also use the intelligent move without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and which causes pain of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process to begin before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dragging with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2564">To display an example of the command line for setting the voice output, it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory.</seg>
<seg id="2565">FreeTTS is an in & Java; written voice generator. currently, it only supports the English pronunciation. the license allows to use FreeTTS for free and to spread without restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2566">To display an example of the command line for setting up voice output, it is assumed that FreeTTS is installed in / usr / local / freett. the speech output is then possible with one of the following three command examples:</seg>
<seg id="2567">For the third example, the option must be turned on as default input. (this is the recommended example of FreeTTS application.)</seg>
<seg id="2568">MBROLA is a voice generator for many languages. it converts a list of phonemes into a Wavedatei, so you need an additional program to disassemble the text in phonemes. the license allows you to use MBROLA for free for non-commercial and non-military applications.</seg>
<seg id="2569">In our example, Hadifax is used to convert German text into phonemes for MBROLA, assuming that Hadifax and MBROLA are installed in / usr / local / hadith and / usr / local / MBROLA.</seg>
<seg id="2570">Unfortunately Hadifax is happy to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added. the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples:</seg>
<seg id="2571">(CAT -; echo quot;) _ BAR _ / usr / local / jihadists / txt2pho -e / usr / local / MBROLA / de1 / de1 / tmp / tmp.wav; rm / tmp / tmp.wav</seg>
<seg id="2572">All parts of the command must be written in one line. the option must be turned on as default input.</seg>
<seg id="2573">The voice output daemon from & kde; (KTTSD) is a language service that provides all & kde; applications a standard interface for voice output. KTTSD is currently being developed in SVN. it uses modules to support different voice output systems.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Since the voice generator setting only takes place in the KTTSD, you only need to use it as a language service in & kmouth.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To setup use the KTTSD language service page, which appears in the settings dialog from & kmouth; appears when KTTSD is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2576">To use it successfully, you need a voice generator (and of course & kde; 3.x). & kmouth; requires about 15 MB of memory (and additional memory for the voice generator), but it depends on your computer and its configuration.</seg>
<seg id="2577">& Kmouth; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text pass through the machine. it is a list of already spoken sentences stored which the user can reissue repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Note that & kmouth; there is no voice synthesizer. a voice synthesizer must be installed on the computer.</seg>

<seg id="2591">Before you can use it, you need to install and adjust program speech dispatcher. see also</seg>
<seg id="2592">At the first start of tmgr or as long as no speakers are set up, the card reader is displayed. see also. if you have at least one speaker set up, the tab General will be displayed. see.</seg>
<seg id="2593">Most TTS synthesizers offer different languages and voices, as well as different male or female ones, or those that differ in volume or speed. you can also set up several variants for a synthesizer. a combination of language, synthesizer, voice, gender, volume and speed is called a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Different actors for the same synthesizer are comparable to several printer queues for the same printer.</seg>
<seg id="2595">If you click on the card reader narrator in ktmugr, the card reader is displayed. this also appears automatically when you start ttsmgr and no speaker is set up yet.</seg>
<seg id="2596">All speakers already established appear in this list. the preferred speakers appear on top of the list. the top speaker is used for speech output if an application does not give a speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2610">Click Apply or OK, then all settings changed on all pages.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The carton card orders will only be shown when KTTSD has been started. to start KTTSD, click the General tab and tick Voice Output (KTTSD).</seg>
<seg id="2612">In & konqueror;, the web browser of & kde;, you can read the text of the displayed web page. check first, if & ktts; runs. then select the text that is to be read and select Tools text in the main menu. after a short time, the speech output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page. you can skip this step, but then many & HTML; header lines and other invisible brands are also read.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & kate; the advanced text editor of & kde;, you can read the displayed text. check first, if & ktts; runs. then select the text that is to be read and select Tools text in the main menu. then the speech output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2615">This also works when & kate; embedded in other applications, such as & eg; in & konqueror; or in & Quanta;.</seg>
<seg id="2616">KNotify is the news system of & kde, which informs you about events you specify. you can also read the text of these messages by ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & Conversation;, the IRC program from & kde;, you can set up various types of messages. you can set up & conversation; for example, in such a way that you will be notified when a message appears in an IRC channel where your nickname occurs. with & ktts; you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Supports a & kde; program KNotify, a menu entry appears notifications in the Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for KNotify differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml, which is included in the scope of delivery by & ktts, is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent to KMail, and also the expression / local / inbox, as it can be assumed in most cases as presupposed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & tts;. for normal work with & tts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is processed in filters before being sent to the program speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace unspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent certain shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the speech-dispatcher program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the continued jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News is the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; someone who steps into the room. & kde; messages are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you expect from the card reader is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just reading such a screen, this output is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. you will be applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character substitute replacers replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & tts; will be delivered with predefined string replaceable filters, which allow replacing chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included in & tts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program which has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card reader, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules for which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it will be processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below. processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and will not be used. filter will be drained from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it just has to differentiate itself from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Erbet column. the list is processed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to scroll the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the & Ctrl; key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can get the application-ID running programs with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -Numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID header-3432 shows, you may only input copete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replace filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Diesen Filter box if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. so the words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can use it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to summarize these expressions. the & kde; - Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the box.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; translating & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Set the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reachable using the PATH environment variable, xsltproc also suffices.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the telephone selection filter, you can send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card reader, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts from kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; passes a text to the filter, it searches for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program presets, which sends the text to & ktts; and the characteristics of the speaker arranged on the tab card speaker. using the microphone selection filter, you can overwrite the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is on your system the & node; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">In order to achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your language settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Diesen Filter box if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, from & kde;, with which programmers can give their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD about & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so that & ktts; this synthesizer can use.</seg>

<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; transformerfilter, but when using the module for Festival, web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta you need to install the (male) voice rab _ diphone so that Sable does not work at all. you have to do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and can be found using the PATH environment variable.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation characters seem to cause errors in the synthesizer, so that whole sets are skipped or just gibish fade. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with specific characters or words, these may possibly be fixed by a string replace filter. see.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated. therefore consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. check also on the website of ktts;, according to information that are not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech-dispatcher program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & tts; for the use of another synthesizer, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or later) including the kdelibs package and the development files for the program "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source archives for you, or downloaded the tarball currently created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you are using a speech synthesizer, first make sure that your speech synthesizer works correctly. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of tmsgr to use the program speech dispatcher. the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech dispatchers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sets. the user can go back to sentence or paragraph, repeat, pause or break the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application displays text to & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it is used, otherwise automatically the most appropriate speaker is selected. if you want to learn more about it, see how & ktts; select a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add Folder on the tab card, and thus insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the tab Speaker Setup will be displayed. as an example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to Festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival. for voices, which are & tts; known, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthesized speech. if you cannot select some regulators and display this grey, the voice you selected does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with greater memory usage) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet created a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after startup, only the desktop icon in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ttsmgr does not work yet, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in queue, along with the application which has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card reader.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for marking text for voice output. this standard includes marks for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of voice and pitch. SSML is part of the voiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice, the festival uses in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single phrases. this can be done faster with reading, since only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the entire text order. this allows you to skip or stop forwarding orders on the card board, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-level detection filters. at the first start of & tts; a set-level detection filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add additional propositional filter filters, however beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to get started is to set up the selection of speakers by trying out. switch on the selection of speakers and enter text to read. check the selection of the speakers again, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes. for that, you must of course have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& tts; then faster with pre-reading can begin, because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel text orders on the card pass, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Flag Recognition Filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional phrases and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never used on & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set-level detection filter, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc included in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can overwrite the language settings for the application on the card reader selection menu.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Using the standard speaker (the top one on the card reader speaker). in other words: no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Using the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktt; select this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not play a role, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field of speakers that best correspond to the following, click the Standard Speaker button and then use the speaker closest to the following.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer even on the card reader device a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The speech speed settings are ignored when & tts; & HTML; prereads. (this is because HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML transformerfilter, and set the speech speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read web pages with a female voice. I have set up a female festival orator, but & tts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>

<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts in the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also matters, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. moreover, it freezes when you pause a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not yet support real pauses. if you are holding a text order in & ktts, the current sentence will be read yet.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good and there are multiple voices and languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help is provided in the instructions provided with the Festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of Festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software at festival / lib / vocals / russian. if you set up the Russian voices, you have to enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding like koi8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; -package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter will be shown. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices when installing & Linux are installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Option Network settings are selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose from the list that best matches distribution and relaasestand. by checking the non-re-prompting setting, the setting can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can access system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... setting up the settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button will display the dialog with more options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are carried out by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system startup, so no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the network mask input field, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on a switched off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking Interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off an activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name in an IP address like about 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution machine part of the Reiters name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with buttons Hinauf or Herunder in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... from the group Computer to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. the Add Name Server dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Computer to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... This dialog will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of known machines describes machine name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list of named hosts contains some entries, which support and apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add... Add New Alias dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the well-known calculator has multiple aliases, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog named Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical user interface such as kpackage or the install tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended by experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile and knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second section all of the & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely used. IPv5 is expected to be implemented in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface. in external networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the point of contact with a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a space reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for specific things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called standard route, the second one loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed loop.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files written by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections so that it is not surprising if there is a different content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which in addition offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective package. the second purpose was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; retrains the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognizes & kdat; does not know the preload on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preload, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked whether the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been included. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through the fold of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band by & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">One type of tape must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the band from & kdat. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, the band continues with the format of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been opened, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the Backup dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog will appear for verification. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog will check. this dialog displays the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before initiating the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the Restore dialog will appear. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the recovery settings, the Restore dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the tape index file using the contents of the tape. this process removes all existing index files for that tape. you can recreate the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of the files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up which are on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file system.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this will cause all the files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, conveys & kdat; before the tape is involved, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, & kdat tries to lock the ejection during the tape drive. this setting may not work for all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, if & kdat is released, the tape will be automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy scammers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, & kdat tries to change the hardware-side block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case report the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds since the time the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, it allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the screenshot below, it provides & ksystemlog; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start attempts, & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will open. it will not appear to you, and instead it opens a small message window, so you have not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files usually don't find themselves under Linux in the folder / var / log, usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or string. to do so, enter a string in the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. then a log file will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then only calibrated with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the Protocol File System Protocol, select the process column, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filterbar, thus show you & ksystemlog; all the log lines sent or created by that process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than log lines of level hint. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can display the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines from the main window's context menu to display all the new log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has an own web page on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. This location provides you with more current information on the reference sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & node; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named so) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init System is rapidly becoming a standard for the control of the program start-up during startup of the system in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and re-formatting. Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to boot when you boot the system or when changing to another run level. system services do not include such things like setserial, which is started only once. such calls are based on rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">For example, rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d when you need it. most of the systems have this file, even if there is not much use to it. you can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to execute something with the serial port when you boot.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program in different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default RunLevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default RunLevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have confused something, then get it repaired by restarting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does all the right scripts start? if you type -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name and if the one contains a K, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc., I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runways to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevel2 or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original runner level (or its position). this only happens when you pull out an entry in the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. in order to just copy them to a new RunLevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously been in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, RunLevel 1 Start, RunLevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another run level, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired RunLevel with Paste (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by repressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine is constantly re-starting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default RunLevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under RunLevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit when their configuration files are not available or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read Chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. either you can use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two tabs, the user name and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it will display the User or Group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users is a map card on which you can make individual settings. more flashcards appear, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Password Management tab appears, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card reader only appears if for at least one built-in file system constraint (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limitation of space in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group assignments of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user on the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the lilo boat manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to booting the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
