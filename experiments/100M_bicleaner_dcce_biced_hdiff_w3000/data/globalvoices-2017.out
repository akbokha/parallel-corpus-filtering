although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed their sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Constitutional Court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very fan@@ ati@@ cal letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his mind , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party ever .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which welcomes people from around the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schauung did not agree with the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ fan@@ a and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr that fights for her life the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Sp@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump cleared his way to nom@@ inate Republi@@ can presidential candidates , she offered me a stop and counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ er as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would you perhaps say they are still important in this Americas ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than he .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( N.@@ B. Ü ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as spin injuries , as the great Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America that promises this promise : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son had fallen sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America .
and that open@@ eth mine heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close association with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gang violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always arrive laugh@@ ing and with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ es , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays - are playing on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the bat@@ on of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all produced from rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
at first it was very difficult , because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash @-@ made violin .
today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
each year , the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land @-@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat IU@@ U fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it searched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly anger@@ ed and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ sed against the ship . they refused to worship one of their ports and refused to give him a permit permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was unable to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia due to the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries that was founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand at each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ stamp , with the information between individual countries cur@@ ated , the actions happen in real time today , with trac@@ eability to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious travel routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will beam its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also if they have a criminal gi@@ ster .
countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially un@@ profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year due to illegal fishermen entering into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing plants , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licensing documents , specifying fantasy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 examinations of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us to the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered from satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Conservation Organisation : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of which the position of each trac@@ eable ship can be viewed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what , it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that were previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly expected to face consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now recorded a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors on board found tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been six countries joined in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also in@@ filtr@@ ated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world ocean .

road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s motion to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness , met in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the Venezu@@ el@@ an regulator ) , images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Veneti@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where the inflation and spices are among the highest in the whole world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and wide @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum on im@@ muni@@ zation for many as the only way to give the country a chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , called on the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly after the 2015 election , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , scheduled to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

on Twitter , pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and ill @-@ treatment are pil@@ ing up .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear coats , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes a round that forms the amount of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an inauguration procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :

here is your de@@ priv@@ ation !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and rather has been pre@@ occupied with silent critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba .
as a now adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now declared against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was committed to investigating crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department of 141 in La Per@@ la prison from 1976 to 1978 .

when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
just get up that they don &apos;t kidn@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - all possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a huge amount of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were turned off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I w@@ ed in and saw a song that people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
they bound a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... as a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carrying ey@@ eb@@ rows .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay face @-@ down - all were tied to hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance people were quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , charged the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military rab@@ bits , that one takes away from an enemy that one has fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... it &apos;s not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never have fallen into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me , and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else !
so was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ator with this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last &apos; h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why should the bodies disappear ?
why not kidn@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought home a girl , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why should their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also had families to whom one could pass their mortal remains ?
the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of showing my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they allegedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he just replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then excuse me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I created the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally cancelled my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court sentenced life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ State terrorism
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian personnel .
Pi@@ ero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court case is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were killed during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the process took more than three years , but the search for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country in which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error to a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was dis@@ semin@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license , witnessed a particularly failed translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fal@@ sely mistaken - but perhaps also with a malicious hin@@ ge &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September 1st to 20th , the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could there be such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is unacceptable to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News focused more extensively with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in the year 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the above @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter published comments in the published version of the article on the light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese are apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo concerning the translation error has , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate the text you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and make active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the belief that translators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who want to learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can still produce translations in the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English language skills are considered the best , becomes the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood at all .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more thorough translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Free Internet ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online stations also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or : activate your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to punish them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond er@@ ron@@ eous or refuse the request when you visit such a website .
we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : this makes it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ta who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she who has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers her minor child or her under@@ age daughter to another more ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprenticeship and a roof over his head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she talked to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta does not generally keep silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in faith , is able to complete her training , to improve her position in society and to &quot; make something out of itself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who receives the girl with him and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent beats . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as an official in the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra came to Mar@@ ín as long as he suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the death of the girl , deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people gathered for protest demonstrations and demanded that there be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows than children are registered , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be ground@@ breaking - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour @-@ power , they live also isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father &apos;s work .
her brothers had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in her employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that her still time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry but didn &apos;t get unlimited food either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could get more books from the library of the landlord than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ist of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the manager Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not pause with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Society endor@@ ses Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the Ñ@@ em@@ by village wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came to Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old history . &quot; she likes small children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s interior who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad switched on again :
dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was closed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ do@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , who had to pay tribute to the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , and the indigenous population had taken tribute to them and the indigenous population went into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted for a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if accepted by the Parliament , users and users of social media must register with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place is to be established that is tas@@ ked with giving citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a punishment of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . because of these , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control violent physical and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ised and ensured that no dis@@ s@@ enting nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison term for those found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish conserv@@ ation@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq &apos;s war

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the article is published here as part of an agreement for content sharing .
high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an Hills in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , stre@@ amed through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and memory of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard really in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera man , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to show passion@@ ately a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , has produced this video for En@@ sia .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a complete pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture still experienced a nuclear accident , alone because of that , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view that progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( with the M@@ ā@@ y@@ ag@@ i k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light .
at the same time , six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by housing est@@ ates ( for a number of years , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was forced to settle in the final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated who lived in housing shel@@ ters after the disaster were moved to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have re @-@ opened its doors by December 2016 , accounting for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of fisher@@ y ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have suffered largely in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , using only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , destroyed by 5 400 hectares , lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dw@@ ellers , it is more difficult to make their living .
is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to establish an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . it questioned them about the status of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that not enough was done in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were moved to permanent replacement houses .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who still live in homes are older than 50 years old in the disaster areas . it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which are scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 2020 .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being beaten by police in national demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march across the country .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer attacking with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers how he hits Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and all the repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s rush to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared on social networks .
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group participated , only to crimin@@ alize teachers . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a stroke .
police over@@ acc@@ esses
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators erected a stage for speakers .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace People ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from using loudspeaker announcements against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped the street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a particular cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of the Un@@ induced Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant harvest of sugar on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after vom@@ iting , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves anew .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an animal who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long , in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already opposed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a reason for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a news .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw a better time .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were ob@@ sol@@ ete technically , and they were hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander during his speech on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
the first letters began before the first year of the war .
it was a matter of officially written documents , which would only differ in relation to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all of them were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the appointed factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant owned by Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build it .
with every part he removed he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the main workplace has been er@@ ased .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services that the plants in the communities in which they were present were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the present person when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the rural community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mas@@ quer@@ ade them , they stopped to asp@@ hal@@ t the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to locate other factories .
they became part of spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in his retirement at Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ iling person , yet he does not for@@ sake the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at age 65 , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter .

as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop makes it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ zo@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to teach the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always have the tongue language profi@@ ci@@ ency in the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and as our youth move forward
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he to Sil@@ en@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and re@@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( as well as some of them ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( with the &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the hec@@ tic district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of these small companies that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend revers@@ es them today in show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile tapes decorated with plastic courts as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the essenti@@ als of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming increasingly sophisticated .
in this case , a royal @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to make your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
some users had doubts on Twitter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon che@@ ated ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also Rei@@ s@@ balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
for more whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # with the Common Sni@@ per .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry , for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and the killed regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports of drug bos@@ ses like El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for instance , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Fear Chang@@ ed Life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs each weekend after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are again preparing for the task we have set before and searching for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me as well .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con le Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as though I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become a Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they remain unaffected by such trage@@ dies when they are not touched and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was pill@@ aged by threats . &quot; in this , she describes how armed criminal month paid money off her business for month , until she had destroyed not only the business , but also tore down her family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I wonder@@ ed if crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega journalist published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation signed by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was viol@@ ated by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has pl@@ agu@@ ed the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this contribution and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or false , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that of the tan@@ ker .
the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people watching the Football World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al pictures of the incident are the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of cab@@ led bodies str@@ ung on the ground while people look at it .
but here history does not come to an end .
over the years , the same photo was taken several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am comb@@ at@@ ants attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically about atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only the follow @-@ up time could only be shown on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the DR Congo appeared again , as fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comment@@ aries such as this fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike blows , rape and many dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts showed up like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian News page , fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein his statement , but had not linked the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false cros@@ spo@@ ints date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ u found 3@@ 44 images below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixing mas@@ h of private sites , social media platforms and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed on false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which they were published . thus , we want to present the reach more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have been linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples can be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of incorrect coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ u , are likely to show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City uses not only the false report but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has contained the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one that used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster which refu@@ te this .

Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme cases of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya will be prosec@@ uted to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judge on what it referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately hidden messages and photos that came to international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this alignment , which has been published exclusively in English , also contains references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ Х@@ р@@ и@@ с@@ т@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ б@@ н@@ и@@ Infl@@ amm@@ ision ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar had admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now @-@ deleted , Catholic @-@ related news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the image of DR Congo , equipped with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massac@@ res and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times res@@ cu@@ ed ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly in circulation by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the Embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was contained , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) also indicate that Tin@@ u is no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in reference to greater discussions on the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion wants to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ intentionally have a share of practicing the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the prolifer@@ ation of violent images has already been discussed in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even called for by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images will des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and feel the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media acts to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used by context or completely impro@@ per nature .
however , every investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally it can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. inv@@ alu@@ able ) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish Sob@@ ol@@ esa ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Ta@@ p Adler language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - get tired of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish even more of these &quot; un@@ sett@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ones , are invited to upload their favorite artists here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ fall catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally works at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya reached the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Emer@@ gency Centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missing because of the floods and mud waves .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places to stay .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the H@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ ly bus was standing in the high water , water level of up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their floo@@ ded villages .
several organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call + 49 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential supplies for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ y@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 49 7@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Pick@@ ups ( Sri Lanka ) taxi call App asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical Storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ ups introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button allowing users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slide .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and help to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human life , whereby Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now facing the long road to restoring norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March arrives in San Francisco on January 21 , 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
use authorized . in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I have given her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we still cry for the rights of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next , we are making rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and humans , some hold the icon@@ ographic image of a woman with a cloth high , bound from an American flag , others make slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were ab@@ domin@@ ating me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hole is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit into it there , will be mi@@ tig@@ ated .
to be sterili@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone with this .
this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception religion Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been coloni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman to be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to fail .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female candidate for the first time in 2016 .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who perform movements for change .
it also ob@@ serves that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which had been brought here with slaves .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has st@@ aff@@ ed our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ lessly that often Si@@ kh men and children are aimed at anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh called Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket cart that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ oked , we don &apos;t carry all ash@@ ash@@ boards with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are being produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information that have manipul@@ ated our already flaw@@ ed image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a foreig@@ ner who breaks the veil on a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it cannot possibly fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they fall back on the following terms : belief , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf would see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , if I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ing the Arab verses to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grand@@ mother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on my mother@@ ly side with her sisters ; how they won a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , which - for centuries - has been coloni@@ zed by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ or British East ini@@ dies Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by coloni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslim means knowing that over the past two centuries , Europeans have &quot; coloni@@ zed &quot; all except four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of the story was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ settled history .
it means to recall that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , had gone to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is four times more reported than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Muslim schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build on this second structural anti @-@ Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regimes , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders towards people from the countries that are being bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is mostly Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we reject to Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically sound picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we M@@ ust Have
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have come too deeply to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the bad and dangerous im@@ prints that we do in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to propag@@ ate more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for the conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who exist in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb lane in my speech .
things that may awaken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story can l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination , had been personally scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and un@@ consciously consoli@@ dating the &quot; other , &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president in which we have no president , while he already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; to other &quot; man @-@ made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a chance to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ removable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS lies not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the project makers :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is connected to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , feel , link &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation lead to the fact that the audience insi@@ sts on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ab@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience who does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;ve listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend it . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story stories .
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ establishment of sovereign debt from the US
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ ce &quot; ( Ci@@ vic front for the ne@@ ural audit of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishment of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Rico require politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt to be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed remuneration corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed from the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration bore the name &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ler , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books finished by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The costs of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police bass was on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Basel &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pre@@ ten@@ tious than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ cross of many civili@@ zations and here are Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not able to know at that time that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and preservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
lo@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he offered me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a trial which she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available licence @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your wit@@ ting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ el &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the International Human Rights Organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do so for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director of corruption caused by corruption again on previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison term in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants on account of mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose council was the Board of Directors of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released due to good management in 2016 and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no barrier for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not promise the promotion well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , abbrevi@@ ated C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
the company apparently kept silent and did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rel@@ uc@@ tant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of which served .
he could give lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director had no moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ ale and serves the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served themselves by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Pr@@ ison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Moz@@ ambique , but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ant and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous verbal represent@@ ations was when he energe@@ tically confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambition to sell his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he was 10 years old and free .
and today the company , in which he has money , sets him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ δ@@ ι@@ ο@@ Emis@@ sions ( @ Az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) , May 12 , 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de explains that crime in Moz@@ ambique pays off :
in fact , in # Moz@@ ambique th@@ ief and servant of # F@@ rel@@ im@@ o , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long @-@ term detention , returns to # Air@@ ports of Moz@@ ambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ ick pe@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spl@@ itting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for its use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung Mi@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a play of words .
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical , before it er@@ ases all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you write to fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all those who hate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy will not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word in order to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to collect , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more prior to the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they would only have a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery amongst users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which did not contain hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat a pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the Myanmar communities , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where thousands of Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law that should ban this practice , so that the age @-@ worthy age is now at 18 .
before this change in the marriage network , some members adher@@ ed to Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN child rights convention , the min@@ ors as , each person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics by the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who had already been married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at the age of 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements endeav@@ ored to aboli@@ sh laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated case , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the pedi@@ at@@ ric was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent committee , so that he could be discussed at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single one against it .
after it has been decided beforehand in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws for children &apos;s marriage were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
member of Facebook , Lov@@ ell Francis , who is minist@@ ering a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk to mask the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 on the other ! ! ! &quot;
follow @ Fi@@ on@@ a@@ we@@ be@@ di@@ tor Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law noted :
the average age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment to the Act of the Association was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were contrary have voted for the law .
the to@@ e is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps should the law be passed , and he now seems to redeem his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that unless Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would go differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
rather , instead of talking about the problem , rather than talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in the advantage of them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or continues to be the norm , although there are laws that forbi@@ d them .

by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page on Wikipedia was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using stra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , in spite of legal bann@@ s , irre@@ voc@@ able .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we &apos;ve done everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in decentr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia participated in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , an M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves when they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera with him and to try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ ro ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I started to kin@@ dle pictures immediately ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood before Jehovah face to face .
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Boo@@ ks appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly living in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women with the utmost care avoid pron@@ ounc@@ ing the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , preserve this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a pseu@@ do court and inf@@ ring@@ ed by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not in the name is common among men . however , they have far fewer testim@@ onies to fear if at all they should not come to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 India , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as child marriage to the ban@@ ishment of HIV and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round was women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open a discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not speaking out loud the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they owe and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practice , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some thought it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she was only hiding during the whole exercise ; another decided to let the whole temper@@ ed fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received numerous reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as bearing the cin@@ er@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the interest @-@ red dot if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not ceased altogether , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ war @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they didn &apos;t get married .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes , mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled up their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that the women could wear it .
next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women ta@@ sted it a few times , but then again stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including myself , are still doing it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like rus@@ hing for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les &apos; official YouTube channel .
on June 29 of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the Japanese Twitter trend was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is today in Japan . for a period of 51 years , they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch just survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese of course make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places that are connected with the band .
and , if you love the Beat@@ les , it is your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course , some companies use the fan base in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day will proceed today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government has now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the Malawi border .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans are being used in Tanzania and Malawi .
it gave the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in South Africa conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are target of ritual attacks , the mos@@ am@@ eli@@ can police warned about the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M thinks that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the acquisition and sale of its organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambique in consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE ON Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams A country where people would be ashamed to go to the street , and would like to take sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation where human beings would indul@@ ge in hon@@ orable pursu@@ its , a country where people would not yet ch@@ ame or bald for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to attain fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the boss of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are sle@@ ek :
Moz@@ ambique authorities are very concerned about the murdered people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who knew him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding the public access to Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ el &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who claimed to be the insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels St@@ ay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el is one of the pione@@ ers in the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have committed themselves for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the organisation of the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime , or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of liver cancer at the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; following the draft of the Ch@@ arta 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive appeals from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his award .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , urged China to release Li@@ u as she announced in an declaration on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the US embassy sum@@ med up an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to intervene and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can get into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing by the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate health care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um further talks :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is calling on China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , and release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u on humanitarian grounds in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan ur@@ ges China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator , Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama : Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed his concern in an explanation on 28 June in Li@@ u and admitted that many people asked him to pray for his well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moving and encouraged as I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and u@@ pris@@ ings to create this valuable land , we can say that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns which are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to its power .
in the end , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he made appropriate questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng urged Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid too much to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the complete tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the Singapore elections are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in that sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , associates correctly and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam commit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam are of grave importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapur afford their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does our prime minister need to pay back ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ ura ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world being exposed and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question posed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; then I replied . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 .
depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered a pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Hock@@ ey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook inside with anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there &apos;s little that makes Canadian different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can attach a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried out small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were to be confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
mit Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be so@@ ber - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
it can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ des Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that saves the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the instructions his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as regards the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which grants absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the not@@ orious programme of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adju@@ st@@ ment Change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , the online content monitored and persons accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy were prosec@@ uted .
Thailand employs a strict obj@@ ection to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Defence ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to purchase expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warn them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison because they supposedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the tribute of Pan@@ em , who was already being used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Asia Minor .

the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ West @-@ Asia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today most Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , there were still more than 10,000 people living here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 approximately 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called ch@@ ry@@ u@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka , symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are in decay and rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens serving all of the community .
now there is only cob@@ bled street with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which houses one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they reti@@ re immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ k@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages during the winter .

about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ j@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ing partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite their relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply disappeared ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she says that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and they all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy rus@@ hes past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the abandoned buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which make sure they are in@@ war@@ dly in their lives .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectac@@ les frame and gold coloured t@@ ed@@ dy earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Afrika .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
currently it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medications that they cannot pay , she massages them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et had lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and not help others . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he flew with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
in the courses the travellers consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with many photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ ids she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly as she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification it is said that the app will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private web@@ chat group .
the police informed the app that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ger &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and the south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often associate extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which is based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked the inhabitants random@@ ly whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the self @-@ awakening technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( as many as many of the number of years ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description out of which the software can pick up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated organisations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities published a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es out after death
one single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything else matters is gone .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both internally and externally .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality rec@@ alls and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth is spinning on the axis of disaster . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough so that I &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us , destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts sought , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a magnificent picture full of my expectations .
at such a moment you are aware that you are fre@@ eing the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only cour@@ ageous enough to scre@@ am when we &apos;re not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look at me and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the yard and into the second office that leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I plan all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one single prisoner and I can immediately set myself without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ cra@@ t left the cell , and I rever@@ ted to an old established communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he ultimately answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there can be no striking facial features on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , that ming@@ le with the fruits of the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear them still scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( such as : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13 har@@ lot of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view .
this is not a home here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co @-@ existence to transform the criminals of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ ble room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of his facial expressions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join these Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ eben and protest against demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say more exactly when insul@@ ts and hits have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to deserve this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to pull as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably originates from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold back your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had bra@@ ided four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not find any pleasure in it , which is why he took his next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my naked body , lying on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me just like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to be terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and get away , you &apos;ll be mis@@ placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he turns to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house that belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ witnesses ( such as : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist that confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned their tried @-@ and @-@ true opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and according to his own statement he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version to U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think like I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he poured into water a n@@ es@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protests against Islam .
basically , the g@@ uts speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries .
hence , one simply avoids doing basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens said a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ tal singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert cancellation .
the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la inv@@ alu@@ able the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to be decided &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply a rhet@@ oric , but actually an emerging reality reflected in Jordan that appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they actually should trust .
in recent years Jordan has increased the number of Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to adequately support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the fight against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be kept in prison for in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort as well as the family &apos;s guarantee are often required for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate from politics his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics was introduced to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself frequently :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program , Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his comments were torn from context , twisted and his opinion cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only one edited version was stre@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ eh , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ pers later , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert has been cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adopted several former government orders and members of the teacher association with the reason@@ ing that they had cri@@ tically vo@@ iced concern in social media comments related to the problems rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is constant giving and taking . Jordan has now resist@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought @-@ out and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally led demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue ra@@ ging and , as a result , resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the ar@@ ca@@ des , drums and dancing were mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years ago , in which armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and straight raz@@ ors

rare appearance and body care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ sers .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens who can follow these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity , even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( additional videos to current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .

the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , to accommodate affection ?
this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( Ep@@ ist@@ les to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which constitutes the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now enter into its ranks and support it in building a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians should unite and help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ llas to welcome them back to society .
the campaign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , to be handed over in person .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more need@@ ful .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally hand over letters .
the F@@ ARC members stood up as they had done earlier in order to receive orders from their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of us@@ efulness of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in @-@ between , &quot; told the policy student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ llas live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never written anything like that in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war too , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the opening ceremony , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion lap .
the students were all grown up as early as the war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als , and gave an insight into their views of the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice from the state to the entire Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people whom I have often seen as monsters and even hate , are also only people with beautiful feelings turned up@@ side down by their living circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were made aware that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people willing to take up arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is totally justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles along our way , but together we will overcome them .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat imposed on the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community , like a ladies &quot; sword , wasn &apos;t created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya conquered the international head@@ lines after reports were published to deal with the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was in reality a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the USA in the last analysis .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos from my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was about to und@@ o a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital last night .
apparently , some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab@@ l@@ ings in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which wings were you put - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , my male name still stands on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful to me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I received threats last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people even spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and res@@ cu@@ ed them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 was placed under the window .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you , it is the number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about sex equ@@ ation , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I am actually trying to look like the person she rec@@ alls from her past - that is my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the present situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : will gay men still be det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to stand up to Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
since then there has been nothing new from them .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I wore my hair long and long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
serious in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in the end it has thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never made a hair cro@@ oked to me either .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
there is a saying in Che@@ chen language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; mock not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes before you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he became prime minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic deteri@@ or@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets .
I don &apos;t pay a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I cycl@@ ed out of influ@@ enza .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bo@@ b@@ bin@@ s with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ wers who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ins who have the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , there is it - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transit identity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling in order to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not at all sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
since the last months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August sh@@ ook the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to rise , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing any more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month has imposed some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to live their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and exer@@ ted great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran and some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only been used to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi@@ ans increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who seek work completed primary school , 55 % of a secondary school finished and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist who resi@@ des in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ kill@@ ings among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
because officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women - who call themselves inter @-@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put out well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general .
for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and triple in it .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used physically , emo@@ tionally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists adopted to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black women and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind , which refer to both the gender and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she lam@@ ented in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human being and margin@@ alized in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs to drive their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program forward .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender , because some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using myself for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ani@@ anism : claims for us to defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment in which my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has highlighted international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , who is committed to protecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was filmed , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the main focus of their work lies on persecuted , poorly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ de in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Struc@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # consec@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reporting the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to protect the persons affected .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had been violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be placed on the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s expert ad did not use anything .
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew her message .
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women make a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must report to law enforcement agencies .
In@@ put@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mal@@ acts and a legal system that does not lower Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation Stri@@ kes and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the available figures are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were reported for domestic violence at the District Office of the District Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 adver@@ ts for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the ads 40 % of women said they were ab@@ used physically , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister , Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , Paraguay dies every ten days due to men &apos;s violence .

invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn &apos;t do anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should always regret her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without calling names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and related how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some kind of complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ an &apos;s case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also by their relatives , they did not receive support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the notification of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ and@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a bill was presented in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ lesser ) movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ izi@@ ds to an independent crime continu@@ ance and to punish har@@ sh@@ ly as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the bill has been changed in a number of ways in order to also win the MEPs for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is pun@@ ish@@ able by up to five years imprisonment .
the original draft law envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence must present themselves , if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ and@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here , so that violence is no longer viewed as normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are offen@@ ded .
we have to reimbur@@ se for such a long time until ill treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . however , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a major set@@ back .

independent media continues to attack in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , serving a year @-@ old sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having lost his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been suffering the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the central bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , to cur@@ tail civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , and to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ sti@@ gate human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , even activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the arrest of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper published since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article titled &quot; High @-@ ranked parties bind hands to justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a ple@@ a dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took over the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief following Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited in any way , including online , from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on the public and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ ian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year career ban was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anian Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the judgment was announced .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari in prison for six months .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six months sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , serving his one year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to happen again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j gives the impression that the om@@ anian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that its journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4. to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association as well as the right to gather peace , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , photo taken with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing on the global healthcare supply .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home in order to support the Serbian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we use only solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
CC : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being promoted differently well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines only make articles available for payment ( called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change food production worldwide
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has bred let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question how many sorts of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents do not only apply to individual varieties but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as grain or cart@@ on species . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still cultiv@@ ating salad , but it takes longer , since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der to which I have to be dump@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far in salads .
and if they stand trial , no one can grow a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to make as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that gets bigger and bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the range of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed they have bred .
however , this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy seed , cross it to breed their own varieties , and do not eat it right away - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the associate professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the diet system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ging of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains freely available to others . in this way , their approach is opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it available for plant bree@@ ders either not at all or difficult to use .
there are not yet such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are in even greater style as a salad or car@@ rot .
a question of perspective
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour is improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is important and also crucial to Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property covers other bree@@ ders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not sponsor any innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders do not have time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to facilitate farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants themselves form it and as a bree@@ der , we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation are needed mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as those who move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is an open source seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them in getting &quot; open source &quot; seeds and selling their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i Bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so that the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it expresses itself against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards sow@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently setting up a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the planned launch of the official launch next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report on aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seeds , exchange and improve their seed policy in order to ensure a stable food supply .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regional and ecological food movement has taken care of where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities are blocking content on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government closed the web site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true - despite this attack and the scor@@ ing of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law its goal , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network origin@@ ating from Qatar due to alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not available in Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider in which Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , is still available .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s block@@ age and reflected what it means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , so it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons by the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website I worked for .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers by changing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the block of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is further wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which they can proceed to court against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves Rob@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation , the U.S. violence in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens from civili@@ zed standards and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of crying out : that &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we , as journalists , do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war @-@ ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that there are 8@@ 43 domains that are controlled by criminal organizations according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to ret@@ ou@@ ch atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is according to her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accoun@@ table responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

according to the statistics of 2015 , 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mor@@ dr@@ ates in a state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ ina emphasizes , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police car and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death cases . for several years , however , the U@@ PP has been under fire after several reports on har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio did not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people .
for this demands the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; stra@@ ined balls . &quot;
war or f@@ ro , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week ago , the police seized the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime over loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and the surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i are not part of the traditional foodstuffs in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the planting of fung@@ i , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seeds origin@@ ating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before inspec@@ ting their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout the East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc . ) to acquire new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ant in the north of Portugal this week .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government to call for a state of state last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts of fire that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 alone , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread across the network and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again in June as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a wide @-@ ranging approach to forest reform introduced by the government following serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as hin@@ dran@@ ce to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed building activity if the applicant had the means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued in the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents searched for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the fire bri@@ g@@ ade work and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the site counted more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - perhaps no more .
at dawn the boy was supposed to break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ habi party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many haz@@ ara felt un@@ protected .
the Tali@@ ban known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara were getting closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sack@@ cloth with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on .
there were no services and no heating there . we mounted nylon in front of the open windows so that we don &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with impro@@ vised bodies in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which , after the registration of the request for asylum , can still go for months .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ pre@@ ten@@ tious life helped A@@ shar@@ af to escape from these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have created businesses , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of its journey to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets , however , reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail and aim to return to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen Report : draft laws from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail .

the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months of their successful submission to the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the expul@@ sion of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was applied by 60 members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may , another MP filed a legislative proposal to introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the bill of law , such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison sentence , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on the basis of one , many human rights groups agree , head@@ light of inter alia weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in Gi@@ za acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat blocking on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ ro@@ gated to le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a fully @-@ le@@ ased action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill , would assure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all unused funds .
the document , published on April 21 , on Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he met in the District Court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the case .
is China willing to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to the new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require approval before writing or sharing messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that thereby the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is now unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only use these rules sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of dis@@ semination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be held responsible for removing content and force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ vern@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as locking in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication said that the site had been closed because it became &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to support a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries in the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
