<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised their sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14 I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Constitutional Court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "I was like the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very fanatical letter of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his mind, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican pre-elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which welcomes people from around the world, a deeply believer person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhfana and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "at the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr that fights for her life the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to Kristi Kappes's commitment, which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Spey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump cleared his way to nominate Republican presidential candidates, she offered me a stop and counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voter as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would you perhaps say they are still important in this Americas?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (N.B. Ü): as much as "white against all other ethnicities"; word play from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as spin injuries, as the great Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America that promises this promise: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son had fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that openeth mine heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close association with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gang violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always arrive laughing and with gleaming eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpanes, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest landfill of Asunción in Paraguays - are playing on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the baton of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all produced from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult, because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a trash-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "shows the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Each year, the world produces about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Land-fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat IUU fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it searched the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly angered and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to worship one of their ports and refused to give him a permit permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was unable to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia due to the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries that was founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand at each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project" "" "Ending Illegal Fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail-stamp, with the information between individual countries curated, the actions happen in real time today, with traceability to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious travel routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will beam its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also if they have a criminal gister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it is about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially unprofitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year due to illegal fishermen entering into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing plants, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licensing documents, specifying fantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You mustn't run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 examinations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has followed and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us to the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Conservation Organisation: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of which the position of each traceable ship can be viewed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what, it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Mr. Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously fished without a license and hardly expected to face consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now recorded a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors on board found towing nets where they were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There have been six countries joined in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also combating illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" Security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used towing nets which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also infiltrated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world ocean.

<seg id="153">Road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's motion to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emptiness, met in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the Venezuelan regulator), images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andenregions Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venetians by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; in the end, however, the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, where the inflation and spices are among the highest in the whole world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and wide-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum on immunization for many as the only way to give the country a chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, called on the demonstrators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly after the 2015 election, as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, scheduled to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="179">Hours later they could leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andenstate Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes a round that forms the amount of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an inauguration procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptive version of an interview conducted by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a now adult man, Quijano has now declared against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was committed to investigating crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department of 141 in La Perla prison from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archives of the archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child has chosen a path of salvation.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">"" "they all called him" "" "Kent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just get up that they don't kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo - the revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian revolutionary workers "party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That's why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - all possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a huge amount of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were turned off and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I wed in and saw a song that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a cot and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They bound a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... as a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and carrying eyebrows.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also charged in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a series of mattresses on which naked men lay face-down - all were tied to hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order came from above that they should be laid.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>

<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie, and I would never have fallen into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought home clothes.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me of being a co-conspirator with this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay my burden on what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="299">I always asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">You could have put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why should their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also had families to whom one could pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The enforced disappearance of the corpses is the last abominable act that one can do to a human being.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license, witnessed a particularly failed translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "on a shield, the Japanese word of the" "" "elderly driver" "" "was falsely mistaken - but perhaps also with a malicious hinge & # 8212; translated as" "" "awful motorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">From September 1st to 20th, the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could there be such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="356">"" "the word" "" "terrible drivers" "" "(German:" "" "awful drivers" "" ") was later replaced by the more appropriate term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News focused more extensively with the phenomenon of "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in the year 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of 11.850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">In this way, their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The above-mentioned reporter published comments in the published version of the article on the light, which show what prejudices some Japanese are apparently against older drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate the text you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and make active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the belief that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who want to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can still produce translations in the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English language skills are considered the best, becomes the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and puzzling sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more thorough translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">"" "main page of the portal" "" "Navegar con Libertad" "" "(Free Internet) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society)." ""</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups who oppose the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was capped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censor: activate your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan providers are again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among veneers with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened to punish them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server will respond erroneous or refuse the request when you visit such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third blocked channel, was discontinued on Thursday 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates the internet connections: this makes it more difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="414">Today, Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testimonies of other Criadita who have been victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use courtesy of Structural.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the abbreviated version of a report published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, decaying schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proud of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she who has become something" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money transfers her minor child or her underage daughter to another more richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over his head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for it countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked to Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Criadita does not generally keep silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in faith, is able to complete her training, to improve her position in society and to "make something out of itself," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who receives the girl with him and justifies his exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent beats. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official in the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira came to Marín as long as he suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the death of the girl, deeply rooted in the paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they described the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered for protest demonstrations and demanded that there be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows than children are registered," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be groundbreaking - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labour-power, they live also isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and lost her father's work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Her brothers had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital Asunción.</seg>

<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">"" "Alvarenga says she never had to go hungry but didn't get unlimited food either." "" "I could get more books from the library of the landlord than food from the fridge," "" "she remembers." ""</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisist of the partido Liberal, a liberal party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the manager Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to not believe the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group, where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and nurses in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administrator of the group is Pepa Kostianovsky, a councillor in the Asunción district.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="487">The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the Ñemby village wrote that she had an eleven-year-old girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman, who also came to Ñemby, offered her 15 year old history. "she likes small children and is very handsome," she wrote.</seg>

<seg id="502">"" "sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted for a bill on" "" "regulating the use and use of social networks" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if accepted by the Parliament, users and users of social media must register with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place is to be established that is tasked with giving citizens a permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could result in a punishment of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that is running over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video surveillance and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattler, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on the national level around Facebook. because of these, it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not yet been known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist, the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they control violent physical and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, this means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximised and ensured that no dissenting narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the Kurdistan Hills in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the Non-Governmental Organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, streamed through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). overall, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and memory of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard really in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera man, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza likes to show passionately a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with the reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a complete prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had left entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident, alone because of that, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view that progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (with the Māyagi kouei juutaku) prefectures were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima represents 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the disaster, evacuated by housing estates (for a number of years, casetsu juutaku) was forced to settle in the final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated who lived in housing shelters after the disaster were moved to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have re-opened its doors by December 2016, accounting for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of fishery ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the nuclear accident have suffered largely in the three prefectures of the agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, using only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land of Fukushima, destroyed by 5 400 hectares, lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to establish an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation. it questioned them about the status of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey provided that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents find that not enough was done in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were moved to permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuees who still live in homes are older than 50 years old in the disaster areas. it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which are scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be greater than common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that a more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we deal with issues that often receive less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>

<seg id="593">Left: the attack against Mateus Ferreira da Silva. photo: Luiz da Luz. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march across the country.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies the social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer attacking with a stick. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers how he hits Goiânia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and all the repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics rush to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, has also appeared on social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip below you can see the attack on Mateus starting from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in a different state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Goiana while he is in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police force. "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing has been divided several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. release with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group participated, only to criminalize teachers. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman who has struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police overaccesses</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil, where brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers deployed rubber bullets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators erected a stage for speakers.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace People (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from using loudspeaker announcements against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have slipped the street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustratively design their front pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo favored a cover story with a bus set in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a particular cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant harvest of sugar on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After vomiting, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran animal who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long, inactive time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already opposed the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a reason for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw a better time.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were obsolete technically, and they were hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro at the sugar factory in Lavander during his speech on 21 October 2002." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeated is" "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began before the first year of the war.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents, which would only differ in relation to the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the appointed factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another plant owned by Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build it.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="690">Take a song from Home to Me - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with the permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they are doing hip-hop thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop makes it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school "Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the tribe of the Kitzokalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to teach the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always have the tongue language proficiency in the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and as our youth move forward</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (with the "plastic models of dishes") of any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the hectic district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small companies that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend reverses them today in showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile tapes decorated with plastic courts as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essentials of Essentials is becoming increasingly sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a royal-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to make your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">Some users had doubts on Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon cheated?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise, for example, colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also Reisballs (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more whimsical plastic dishes you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # with the Common Sniper.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry, for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and the killed regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learning to live with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For instance, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and governance." ""</seg>

<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as though I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become a Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being" "" "rebellious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they remain unaffected by such tragedies when they are not touched and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family was pillaged by threats." in this, she describes how armed criminal month paid money off her business for month, until she had destroyed not only the business, but also tore down her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I wondered if crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "Mario Gutiérrez Vega journalist published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation signed by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was violated by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015 whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has plagued the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or to expose a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or false, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected and devastated for years. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to that of the tanker.</seg>
<seg id="828">The authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people watching the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several pictures of the incident are the gruesome scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of cabled bodies strung on the ground while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram combatants attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only the follow-up time could only be shown on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo appeared again, as falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of misattributions; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal commentaries such as this falsify the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike blows, rape and many dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against the Rohingya, posts showed up like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian News page, falsely claimed that President Myanmar's Thein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in reference to greater discussions on the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion wants to be understood and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally have a share of practicing the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent images has already been discussed in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even called for by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images will desensitise readers and viewers and feel the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media acts to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used by context or completely improper nature.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally it can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. invaluable) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish Sobolesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Tap Adler language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - get tired of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- the comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed up in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a chance to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unremovable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS lies not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the project makers:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is connected to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, feel, link" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and representation lead to the fact that the audience insists on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamabara tells the fables of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamus ara is asked:" "" "how is this to speak to an audience who does not understand your language?" "" "with a broad grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You've listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend it. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story stories.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for reestablishment of sovereign debt from the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started with the Mexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuce" (Civic front for the neural audit of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishment of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico require politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt to be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed remuneration corresponding to our working conditions, which acts in favor of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that will be held in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # Frebassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühler, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books finished by so-called 'Book Sprints', read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The costs of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police bass was on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basel's cultural prototypes was more pretentious than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosscross of many civilizations and here are Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know at that time that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and preservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Logically, Bassel couldn't finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He offered me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a trial which she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director of corruption caused by corruption again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison term in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants on account of misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council was the Board of Directors of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released due to good management in 2016 and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no barrier for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not promise the promotion well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, abbreviated CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent and did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "reluctant" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of which served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he consented to be reintegrated into the company that he helped inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director had no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">"" "" "" "Cambaza lacks morale and serves the state," "" "* he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served themselves by the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored for its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings, which have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmesan 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Miat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a play of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical, before it erases all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism won't understand what you write to facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all those who hate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy will not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the censored word in order to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to collect, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more prior to the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would only have a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery amongst users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which did not contain hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat a peas curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail that contains the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says," "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people then?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the Myanmar communities, especially in the area of Rakhine, where thousands of Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps should the law be passed, and he now seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said that unless Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would go differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather, instead of talking about the problem, rather than talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply talk about the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in the advantage of them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's marriage in different gradations is legal or continues to be the norm, although there are laws that forbid them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page on Wikipedia was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using strapping tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of legal banns, irrevocable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via Wikipedia), we've done everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia participated in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, an Mirrorseite from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlenient rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry a camera with him and to try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarro (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I started to kindle pictures immediately!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood before Jehovah face to face.</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Books appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares at me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, mostly living in a tent to take pictures of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the utmost care avoid pronouncing the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State of Odisha was convicted by a pseudo court and infringed by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not in the name is common among men. however, they have far fewer testimonies to fear if at all they should not come to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 India, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as child marriage to the banishment of HIV and AIDS infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion round was women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open a discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not speaking out loud the name of their husbands is a custom that they owe and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "practice, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some thought it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they all asked," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only hiding during the whole exercise; another decided to let the whole tempered frustration come out against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received numerous reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as bearing the cinerred dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the interest-red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased altogether, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to take care of who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salwar-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they didn't get married.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled up their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that the women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then again stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, are still doing it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like rushing for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1555">"" "the music of the cult band is" "" "more than just a universal language like English," "" "Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review." ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of people for organ trafficking, presumably for superstitious purposes, concerns the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the Malawi border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs of shamans are being used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It gave the local superstition that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, said the police spokesman of Zambézia the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with Albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in South Africa conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM thinks that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the acquisition and sale of its organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of Zambézia, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in consideration (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate the riches.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized because of liver cancer at the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," following the draft of the Charta 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a speaker that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive appeals from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his award.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, urged China to release Liu as she announced in an declaration on 30 June:</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US embassy summed up an angry response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to intervene and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate health care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum further talks:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada is calling on China to uphold its international human rights commitments, including freedom of expression, and release the rights for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>

<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu on humanitarian grounds in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan urges China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator, Yu Mei-nu, of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>

<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed his concern in an explanation on 28 June in Liu and admitted that many people asked him to pray for his well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moving and encouraged as I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and uprisings to create this valuable land, we can say that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmuamalgam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns which are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, during the last week of Shanmuamalgam, responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He made appropriate questions with non-replies of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urged Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid too much to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the complete transcript of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmuamalgam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he said," "" "why the Singapore elections are so unimportant even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in that sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuamalgam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, associates correctly and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Herr Shanmugam commit" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmuamalgam are of grave importance.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook inside with anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that saves the Junta, which took power in 2014 and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the instructions his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video still refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as regards the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these photos of the video, which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is to purchase expensive submarines, although security experts warn them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacles frame and gold coloured teddy earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Afrika.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it's rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medications that they cannot pay, she massages them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on their way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Mrs. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet had lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "he said, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and not help others. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras he flew with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travellers consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair braids she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users, with a number of levels.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web purification").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the notification it is said that the app will" "" "prevent" "" "access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private webchat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed the app that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution paths of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanger's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region." ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and the south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often associate extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China," which is based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police inspectors checked the inhabitants randomly whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the self-awakening technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (as many as many of the number of years) also published a Jingwang product description out of which the software can pick up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated organisations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities published a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he turns to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house that belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felicyewitnesses (such as: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist that confronts the conservative majority and questioned their tried-and-true opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and according to his own statement he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion to U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation" - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think like I am a man," "" "as he poured into water a nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protests against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the guts speak lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, one simply avoids doing basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens said a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontal singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the band's commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which questioned the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila invaluable the jordan people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continue to be decided "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply a rhetoric, but actually an emerging reality reflected in Jordan that appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved to traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years Jordan has increased the number of Honorary murders - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to adequately support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fight against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be kept in prison for indefinite period of time," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort as well as the family's guarantee are often required for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate from politics his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics was introduced to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself frequently:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and every other is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian online program, Roya, to remember later that his comments were torn from context, twisted and his opinion censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only one edited version was streamed," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nueh, who was supposed to work on behalf of the calipers later, was able to write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service adopted several former government orders and members of the teacher association with the reasoning that they had critically voiced concern in social media comments related to the problems rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is constant giving and taking. Jordan has now resisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought-out and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach real and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially led democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue raging and, as a result, resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the arcades, drums and dancing were marched over more than a thousand years ago, in which armies from the west of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare appearance and body care were rare as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens who can follow these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity, even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (additional videos to current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy school, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages of guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel expelled, to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la Reconciliación (Epistles to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary armed forces), which constitutes the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now enter into its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians should unite and help in the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, to be handed over in person.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more needful.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally hand over letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members stood up as they had done earlier in order to receive orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of usefulness of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in-between," told the policy student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "I have never written anything like that in my life, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war too, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the opening ceremony, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion lap.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as early as the war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views of the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice from the state to the entire Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people whom I have often seen as monsters and even hate, are also only people with beautiful feelings turned upside down by their living circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were made aware that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people willing to take up arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles along our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat imposed on the LGBTQ community, like a ladies "sword, wasn't created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya conquered the international headlines after reports were published to deal with the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital last night.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had received everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stablings in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you put - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, my male name still stands on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful to me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I received threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people even spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and rescued them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 was placed under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't believe, you're in security just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you, it is the number 115" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about sex equation, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I am actually trying to look like the person she recalls from her past - that is my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the present situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction.</seg>

<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there has been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect such actions are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Serious in Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>

<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never made a hair crooked to me either.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">There is a saying in Chechen language: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "mock not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes before you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he became prime minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily on the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cycled out of influenza.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>

<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transit identity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling in order to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be here so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August shook the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to rise, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month has imposed some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to live their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and exerted great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran and some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only been used to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzians increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who seek work completed primary school, 55% of a secondary school finished and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist who resides in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of self-killings among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women - who call themselves inter-sectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put out well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple in it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention the way we have always been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists adopted to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord, "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist violence, which we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black women and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refer to both the gender and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "she lamented in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human being and marginalized in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs to drive their egocentric program forward.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender, because some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the Movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanianism: claims for us to defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most of the names were changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had been violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be placed on the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to maltreatment, Ada Báez's expert ad did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman withdrew her message.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women make a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must report to law enforcement agencies.</seg>

<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads were reported for domestic violence at the District Office of the District Office. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 adverts for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women said they were abused physically, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, Paraguay dies every ten days due to men's violence.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn't do anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should always regret her.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without calling names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and related how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn't leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some kind of complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also by their relatives, they did not receive support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an irreconcilable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echandri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">A bill was presented in the Paraguayan parliament on 10 August 2016, known as the hashtag # Porellas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos (# non-lesser) movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to explain Femizids to an independent crime continuance and to punish harshly as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the bill has been changed in a number of ways in order to also win the MEPs for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft law envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence must present themselves, if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echandri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place here, so that violence is no longer viewed as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts are complicit and contribute to the fact that the perpetrators are offended.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to reimburse for such a long time until ill treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the paraguayan senate. however, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was cancelled, which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The submission of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a major setback.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for its coverage of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, serving a year-old sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having lost his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has been suffering the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the central bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, to curtail civil liberties, including freedom of the press, and to torture, intimidate and instigate human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, even activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the arrest of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper published since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, announced that an article titled "High-ranked parties bind hands to justice" was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of 3,000 omian Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year career ban was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit of 5000 omanian Rial (13 000 US dollars) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the judgment was announced.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Haj on 26 December 2016, but condemned Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari in prison for six months.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six months sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, serving his one year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court to allow Azamn to happen again, the newspaper still faces attacks by the government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement, in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and the Minister once again appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal to re-publish the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">The continuing closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of journalist Al-Haj gives the impression that the omanian authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that its journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, photo taken with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing on the global healthcare supply.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists helps build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home in order to support the Serbian healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change food production worldwide</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question how many sorts of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents do not only apply to individual varieties but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as grain or carton species. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still cultivating salad, but it takes longer, since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder to which I have to be dumped." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far in salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand trial, no one can grow a new type of salad because all the features are already patented. "he continues to make as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that gets bigger and bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Römersalat of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the range of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy seed, cross it to breed their own varieties, and do not eat it right away - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the diet system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds, whose recent examples are the merging of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a" "" "seed sovereignty" "" "is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains freely available to others. in this way, their approach is opposed to patenting seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of the Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it available for plant breeders either not at all or difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are not yet such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are in even greater style as a salad or carrot.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour is improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is important and also crucial to Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property covers other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not sponsor any innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to facilitate farmers" "" "work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" "" "we do not really create the features themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants themselves form it and as a breeder, we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed mass herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as those who move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"" "Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "" "it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is an open source seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the centre cooperates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still, the Egyptian authorities are blocking content on the internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government closed the web site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true - despite this attack and the scoring of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law its goal, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">"" "ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar due to alleged" "" "support of terrorism" "".

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not available in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which Ziadas blog is located, on the other hand, is still available.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blockage and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, summons by the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers by changing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the block of websites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is further worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which they can proceed to court against these acts." ""</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is killed in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves Robben pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation, the U.S. violence in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "The is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "" "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that happens from civilized standards and what happens only in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of crying out: that's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we, as journalists, do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war-rubric in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that there are 843 domains that are controlled by criminal organizations according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to retouch atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is a "war." this is according to her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accountable responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecina emphasizes, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a Favela by deploying a massive police car and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death cases. for several years, however, the UPP has been under fire after several reports on harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio did not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this demands the state to use means and means that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "strained balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or fro, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week ago, the police seized the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime over loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, in Damascus and the surrounding area, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013, demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi are not part of the traditional foodstuffs in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, it makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>

<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12.700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal this week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government to call for a state of state last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts of fire that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 alone, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when residents searched for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used fogos.pt's own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahhabi party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many hazara felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred of the Hazara were getting closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf returned to Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sackcloth with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we mounted nylon in front of the open windows so that we don't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "" "with improvised bodies in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which, after the registration of the request for asylum, can still go for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either reliant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unpretentious life helped Asharaf to escape from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was presented for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have created businesses, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of its journey to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs targets, however, reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail and aim to return to the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "so they can sell their crop surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end stands stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he also wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use social networks within six months of their successful submission to the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the expulsion of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by 60 members of parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "may, another MP filed a legislative proposal to introduce tougher penalties for the insult of the president or a high official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the bill of law, such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, just like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison sentence, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty on the basis of one, many human rights groups agree, headlight of inter alia weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their coverage of the pro-Morsi seat blocking on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists interrogated to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben-Gharbia was mainly interrogated to a fully-leased action plan. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill, would assure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unused funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document, published on April 21, on Nawaat's website, sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben-Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he met in the District Court in Tunis on 09th May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Is China willing to force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require approval before writing or sharing messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that thereby the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is now unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only use these rules selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as an" "" "organiser of dissemination" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to be held responsible for removing content and force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnovernniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedias locking in Turkey, after Wikipedia admins refused to erase two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication said that the site had been closed because it became "an information source that cooperates with groups to support a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries in the world, in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
