that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA had listened to illeg@@ ally tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in it , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA rendered literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has determined against ris@@ en and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy journalists .
according to the first constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish cover@@ t information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ ageous that they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had for years had indications that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped in ris@@ ings .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing to diver@@ t and ris@@ e to make statements , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , kept his phone bill secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit agreement , and even travel cards with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised his accession to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government down@@ gra@@ ded too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ cker went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitution because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology makes it possible to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet been available when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Code , an open source transfer system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet world , the Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any common contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the start .
however , Secure@@ Code is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger us all .
it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ,
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who suggests the alarm to the poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall @-@ street in@@ sider who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain . &#93; this week we were asked by news of a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has sent let@@ ter@@ box firms to tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting for the next release , and the next revealed documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agent ri@@ ll@@ ers or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are being used by a few to hide and conc@@ eal their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is true that in some US states you need less information , need less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to get suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked that all except one lawyer made proposals on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investigation .
it &apos;s not about a single top politicians involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to do this , we have to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
it may sound very in@@ ventive as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I do see that some things have started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , we have seen pushing for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has entered central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have tab@@ led a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how do I please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what had I lost there ?
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ e@@ zing at the toes to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap of time , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ chat@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept of it .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
through the Internet , they can invite other people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet flight of panic you can feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can &apos;t just read their SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who is Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please on Twitter announce that he is candidates for the Office of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children were called ?
imagine you had 150 convic@@ tions who all say : &quot; he can really hold tightly locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
this is because a well thought @-@ out feedback system is vital to reinfor@@ ce confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately we decided to wait until both the host and guest had left their convic@@ tions before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
not surprisingly we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation pi@@ cks up com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m on vacation with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put aside those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not covered before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have celebrated un@@ allowed parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts already when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men trusted one another .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgement :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
you can stay even longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a matter of economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not just the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when travelling today , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for it .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit a group there , a group of residents would wait to thoroughly fill in and show one at a pub pent@@ our neighborhood you &apos;ve never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we were to shape apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of common participation ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were conveyed to people whose children were exp@@ elled . incu@@ b@@ ator programmes were started ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I do not blame you for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were app@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , and compared to the pressure I was 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I was able to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender that deep@@ ened every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flying in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should we do this ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspi@@ cious one .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start building studies .
I remember -- when we went silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well @-@ lit areas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t feel sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard from attacks on Muslims or by people who were considered Muslims to be free and bru@@ ised .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have stri@@ pped the people &apos;s anger on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can actually say people today : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , D.@@ C. recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radic@@ alization process it has been determined that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mis@@ m group believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology to be based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not push what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her rage , she was a major target for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and to its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que forbi@@ d her to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several ne@@ uro @-@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian governing system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if people read messages in which negative is reported on Muslims , they rather vo@@ iced military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to raise the foundations of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the Dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited him in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mos@@ que or were we staying safe at home ?
we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son sitting in the children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
as usual , I &apos;m as ordinary as it is allowed .
when one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did so with the largest study conducted on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before blowing air packages into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by joining them , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ ant structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculate the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rear starter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a flight machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers it can float , and has big advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that no matter what position the aircraft can regain the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . OK .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with thousands of movable parts to get together to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies worked with only one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically simple remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood to throw it right if I all watch it is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in in@@ suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when they are assembled , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making half of them f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic rub@@ b@@ ish .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression .
we took common micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
a flying lamp shade would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were orbit@@ ing each other faster and faster in a very distant gal@@ axy , so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all the gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events tim@@ ately .
1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has yiel@@ ded a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is up to us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ ating black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser interfer@@ ometer and gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved recognition performance .
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes passed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell from my deadly sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes and her through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pp@@ le in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity , lec@@ turers often perform a really traditional dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves hit . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore the Lig@@ o staff explained to be crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured accurately to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of a nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical essay about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the search for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are resour@@ ceful and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical . for instance , you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
in sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now speaks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can do with them no simple images of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe talking .
the gravit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
when the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same chir@@ ping with an additional change of tone . that sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- When Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; No , who knows what to hear , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circles a hundred times per second before colli@@ ding .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to All and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through since these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own night glow .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there are things that we have never seen before that we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the sau@@ ri@@ ers for our archaeological work , so to speak .
Lig@@ o makes us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists in being as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago , I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear of talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for un@@ explained reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from then on , I s@@ wore to always play with them whenever you call me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I &apos;m going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things look like , raise your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce TV .
I watch television , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , at once four , 16 episodes : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who still does that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just going around on the computer and fanta@@ sizing , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams with a dre@@ am@@ job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I ordered troops , as if I painted on a canvas .
as long as you &apos;re wearing a high sound , run a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ar@@ du@@ ous and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could drive on it forever .
a lot of people accept when I tell them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the tot@@ um is more than writing .
the tot@@ em is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you can &apos;t strive differently than by size .
the feeling of not being able to walk differently than to strive for size no matter what price .
this is called the tot@@ um .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land which I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the linen , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this bu@@ zz@@ ing ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t like my job any more . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do what you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another , and this gives you a bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , and know how the bu@@ zz is when you stop the h@@ um , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and get my bu@@ zz , and everything changes from my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , watch@@ ful pen@@ cils and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl lets loose in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium dioxide , that is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the tot@@ um is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the tot@@ um is the current that comes from the lust of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is a law , I have no choice but I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t know how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a man pre@@ fers to be in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , I .
let &apos;s be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we rus@@ hed around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
in doing so , I mostly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always travel to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me for 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter talks to me for 15 minutes , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find it out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the tot@@ um came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the tot@@ em of life .
the tot@@ um of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ ff to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land that I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sum : the sum of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things look like , I wake you up to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
surely they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; depth brain stimulation . &quot; thereby one im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is s@@ wollen with skull @-@ brain trauma and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , one has to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
it is necessary to find the proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may know from the biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they par@@ ted slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean @-@ François
and then mark them in color , in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we reim@@ ported them to the collection point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ar these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ plant@@ ar the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we reim@@ ported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they had been taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ation exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with apes .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we reim@@ ported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that they were very exciting for us too .
since then , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as in@@ variable maj@@ esty .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his big neighbor in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who repeatedly said that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy .
I be@@ g you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group , succ@@ um@@ bed to a mis@@ belief , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the topic of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the mountain of debt ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unt@@ apped cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , which , however , are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and income that could be deduc@@ ted from the debt mountain and could produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the USA , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds after a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe jo@@ bless , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , like in an endless loop , reinfor@@ ces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , out of fear , the prophecy of the ro@@ cket could be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily causes the circumstances that lead to the killing of the body .
this is my Ha@@ ze with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we see under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these degrees .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which accor@@ ded them the right to political participation with the same voting wei@@ ghting in matters of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is quickly burnt out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and business was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually ero@@ ded politics and de@@ vised it .
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not on a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because they can be in the government these days , and yet not in power , because the power is emig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds on , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has har@@ med politicians so far that they themselves are har@@ ming themselves by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political est@@ ates are exploited , the ine@@ quality falls , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation allows the twin peaks to become higher , the waste of subli@@ me , and social conflicts deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and people inf@@ ect their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life indul@@ ges .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the area of the company : imagine a capital market where you make money while you work and in which your capital follows from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and redemption , and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees working there that the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and in the end no hed@@ ging twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : just imagine that our national currencies would have a freely oscill@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have it , especially against the background of a re @-@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they preferred privileged individuals , and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , globally Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Fr . Giuss@@ ani ...
in your biography you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers den@@ otes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , therefore , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfect too .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have clearly stated what you think from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
we have the appearance of democracy in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells enormously after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected this would come .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to mas@@ sively thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone have also elected den@@ ial within the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to keep an economic system , which is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : everyday .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ ank ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims that he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the don@@ or &apos;s side to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring down our government , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions going through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been conducting a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for the past five years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the Troika of the financi@@ ers , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will also be compatible to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company at Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fris@@ eur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating will get .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- which should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not care about falling on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle release , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch for free .
and if Amazon publishes things for free , do you access , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping over and / or looking at once again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a bit above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked for .
about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went to a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series over a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question now is : what happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data @-@ driven companies .
they connect these lots of data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what does this mean ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work in such a way , it is somewhat frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we go more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not it is released .
just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also incorrect .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that it can predict out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worst kind of data analysis -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life - at the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do princip@@ ally two things :
first you dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which they otherwise would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things can go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will f@@ use it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have been able to hear the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
