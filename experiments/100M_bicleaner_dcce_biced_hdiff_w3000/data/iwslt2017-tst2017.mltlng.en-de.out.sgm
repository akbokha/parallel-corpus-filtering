<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had listened to illegally telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA rendered literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has determined against risen and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish covert information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had for years had indications that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped in risings.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to divert and rise to make statements, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his understanding, kept his phone bill secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit agreement, and even travel cards with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised his accession to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government downgraded too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistle-blocker went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitution because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology makes it possible to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet been available when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureCode, an open source transfer system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet world, the Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any common contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureCode is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have the possibility to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who suggests the alarm to the polluted water of Flint. or a wall-street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [huge sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.] this week we were asked by news of a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has sent letterbox firms to tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting for the next release, and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agent rillers or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are being used by a few to hide and conceal their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is true that in some US states you need less information, need less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to get suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked that all except one lawyer made proposals on how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covert investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politicians involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to do this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very inventive as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I do see that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years, we have seen pushing for more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has entered central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have tabled a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>

<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the corps of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>

<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how do I please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what had I lost there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneezing at the toes to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap of time, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former mate, Nate Blechatczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the Internet, they can invite other people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things that you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you can feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't just read their SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please on Twitter announce that he is candidates for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children were called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 convictions who all say: "he can really hold tightly locked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">This is because a well thought-out feedback system is vital to reinforce confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both the host and guest had left their convictions before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation picks up commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "great works of art in your home! I'm on vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put aside those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have celebrated unallowed parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than those calls. it hurts already when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without charging the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is not just the" "" "rental industry" "" "to be called" "" "rental industry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When travelling today, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for it.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit a group there, a group of residents would wait to thoroughly fill in and show one at a pub pentour neighborhood you've never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to shape apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were expelled. incubator programmes were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>

<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>

<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were appalled:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US's body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, D.C. recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process it has been determined that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremism group believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology to be based on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not push what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her rage, she was a major target for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and to its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque forbid her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuro-scientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian governing system, conformance and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if people read messages in which negative is reported on Muslims, they rather voiced military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to raise the foundations of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the Dental Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who visited him in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be fatal, not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son sitting in the children's seat, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went to the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say you're holding a TEDTalk, a thinker, working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm perfectly normal.</seg>

<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">As usual, I'm as ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at Muslims around the world, and I did so with the largest study conducted on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before blowing air packages into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By joining them, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-reliant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculate the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"" "this is a so-called" "" "rear starter" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrflüglers it can float, and has big advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that no matter what position the aircraft can regain the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for example as machines with thousands of movable parts to get together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies worked with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and lateral rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it right if I all watch it is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in insufficiency, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When they are assembled, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half of them flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took common micro-quadcopters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">A flying lamp shade would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes were orbiting each other faster and faster in a very distant galaxy, so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy, however, did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us classify the events timately.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has yielded a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is up to us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the Laser interferometer and gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my deadly sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and her through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In courses on the theory of relativity, lecturers often perform a really traditional dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore the Ligo staff explained to be crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured accurately to less than one thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical essay about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the search for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for instance, you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaks just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe talking.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">When the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same chirping with an additional change of tone. that sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- When Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] No, who knows what to hear, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circles a hundred times per second before colliding.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through since these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the Big Bang is covered by its own night glow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before that we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauriers for our archaeological work, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists in being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for unexplained reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from then on, I swore to always play with them whenever you call me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things look like, raise your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I watch television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production, at once four, 16 episodes: 24 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I'm talking about work, so you understand that I'm not just going around on the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams with a dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I ordered troops, as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As long as you're wearing a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, arduous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is humming.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could drive on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">A lot of people accept when I tell them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The totum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totem is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you can't strive differently than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to walk differently than to strive for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the totum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land which I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the linen, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzzing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda Country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly faded away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do what you're doing, you're doing what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another, and this gives you a buzz when you know the buzz, and know how the buzz is when you stop the hum, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no more" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and get my buzz, and everything changes from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, watchful pencils and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl lets loose in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium dioxide, that is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True humming ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no choice but I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't know how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"" "this concession is painful, because what a man prefers to be in" "" "home" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Let's be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rushed around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always travel to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones don't want to play with me for 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teenage daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in order to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totum came back in my spare time. the buzz then seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzzing, the buzzing is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totem of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snuff to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the best known, the "depth brain stimulation." thereby one implanted an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is swollen with skull-brain trauma and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one has to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">It is necessary to find the proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may know from the biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They parted slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color, in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimported them to the collection point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantar these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplantar the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they had been taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplantation exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor-motor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we reimported the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, such as Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as invariable majesty.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his big neighbor in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup, succumbed to a misbelief, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are brighter, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of untapped cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, which, however, are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and income that could be deducted from the debt mountain and could produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the USA, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3,4 trillion US dollar sounds after a lot of money, until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe jobless, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, like in an endless loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, who, out of fear, the prophecy of the rocket could be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily causes the circumstances that lead to the killing of the body.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Haze with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we see under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the importance of Athenian democracy on the basis of these degrees.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which accorded them the right to political participation with the same voting weighting in matters of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and business was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, while the economy gradually eroded politics and devised it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because they can be in the government these days, and yet not in power, because the power is emigrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, which so sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds on, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has harmed politicians so far that they themselves are harming themselves by the self-caused economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political estates are exploited, the inequality falls, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism expels the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation allows the twin peaks to become higher, the waste of sublime, and social conflicts deeper, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to that in "Matrix," or something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve human beings and people infect their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life indulges.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the" "" "matrix" "" "-like dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: imagine a capital market where you make money while you work and in which your capital follows from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and redemption, and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees working there that the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and in the end no hedging twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: just imagine that our national currencies would have a freely oscillating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today, we have it, especially against the background of a re-unified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberally, in which they preferred privileged individuals, and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Fr. Giussani...</seg>
<seg id="980">In your biography you describe yourself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers denotes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, therefore, I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfect too.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have clearly stated what you think from the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">We have the appearance of democracy in our liberal democracies.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say that provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To blame China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells enormously after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected this would come.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone have also elected denial within the eurozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to keep an economic system, which is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: everyday.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Ernsthank...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or any minister who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims that he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfriseur and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating will get.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where is more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- which should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care about falling on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle release, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon publishes things for free, do you access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skipping over and / or looking at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a bit above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked for.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went to a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series over a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question now is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">There are two very competitive, data-driven companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these lots of data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work in such a way, it is somewhat frightening because we live in a time when we go more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not it is released.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of influenza, the worst kind of data analysis -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year around year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life - at the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do principally two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First you disassemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things can go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have been able to hear the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
