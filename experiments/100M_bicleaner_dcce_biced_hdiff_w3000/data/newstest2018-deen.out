Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young@@ sters are to meet today .
a mine chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the erst@@ while ground of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to day .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car navigation system instead of a b@@ ypass road showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - yet very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one cannot recognize as such .
in the large map of the map , detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; composition sheets &quot; were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first survey in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally moved away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / today is most impressive by the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was introduced 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Saxony were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming there appears a smaller @-@ scale card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ an@@ ium &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots do not occupy any farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the composition paper , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ nen &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once closed people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich County Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Venti@@ lation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was in charge of the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the anchor of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients there was first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar , 1905 .
Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany , has been there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet now on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and moved it to a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected - in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Head Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a mining chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn family route takes place .
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ables has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and ra@@ cial attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls upon Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state and take extreme caution because a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , prompted the group to publish the warning message , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosecutor Office , which shows that 75 percent of black mot@@ ori@@ sts are being employed as wh@@ ites in the state .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Chapel said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared if they bring a deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th position of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
at the right @-@ wing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U location met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and lod@@ ged in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area care for a lot of work , much has to be processed with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often critic@@ ised for the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of maintenance is 40 hectares , which may not be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was funded by leader , a quarter carried by the community of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of electric f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor set specified by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the area to be enclosed must not be tu@@ pper@@ y ( slope tilt above 35 percent ) and must thus be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ fence project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .
the area of maintenance corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump sums up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have done it if he had done it .
but he attacked its importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to it , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he himself put it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the el@@ event@@ h fall of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the exile .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the will they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever recognize .
her torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred that is her only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members at a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ man belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ re will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is being developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team as a team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in was great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year set five British and two European records .
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season that included the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell &apos;s team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special thing about this team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
in regard to my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics via Facebook : do not mess about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he sli@@ pped in at the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was compl@@ aining of him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fri@@ vo@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the online comment was full of a back@@ lash with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he obtained the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not full of hate , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some more as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical disgu@@ ises or arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County made the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable serv@@ ings had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ powered his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Left to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year are coming back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to action on the home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections turn out to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are half@@ way in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the construction of the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and lock@@ outs is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the un@@ settled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the carb@@ oni@@ zed tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the ground floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 p.m. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ate@@ en and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the town of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and made of corrugated roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her vivid , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued at 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth an estimated 78 billion US dollar .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military in 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
last year alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the Erz@@ s@@ ö@@ z@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the indigenous pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as the Jok@@ er , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after the inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local minister Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their gun @-@ mates , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita dance - circul@@ ating in a circle and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird song - from Pap@@ ua Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his multic@@ ol@@ ored wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still don &apos;t know who fired but says that the ball from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here came .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans wearing only one name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Che@@ ek@@ inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of Defence , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said in October 2016 that he will set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , whom the UN has charged for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with gri@@ ev@@ ous dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company who refused to take a unconscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to be held accoun@@ table and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ point for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by shooting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ al .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal committee of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s election campaign were not realized in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ the@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health care services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot cas@@ u@@ alties led a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried in a complex just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and scre@@ aming people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units cleared the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can rein@@ vigor@@ ate issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch Building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : far@@ ther Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single , which was revolutionary for this sport , was only to be played on two cont@@ ests , but very thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very appreciated five @-@ set classics , the traditional competition is thus preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the rate of application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already come to carry out the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are relatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring forbidden objects to the plane , find out a survey
a survey conducted among passengers shows that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously prohibited items are s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had delayed late that they were er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people , conducted by a Jet Charter Service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to know@@ ingly carry items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it had inter@@ viewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods caused by airport security and how many would have done so intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to carry s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety of those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the biggest quantity of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA is forbidden .
for a while the people thought that the T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : cancel tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gladly returns with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that part of the customers have already with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more col@@ os@@ sal sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less da@@ zz@@ ling number : the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months Mus@@ k frequently had with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now , Mus@@ k has dre@@ amed : 63@@ ,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders .
critics have always pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available , in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la provided 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines never tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of the failure of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a term that expi@@ red on 1 October for States to meet the 2015 standards for o@@ zone near soil .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay adher@@ ence to a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been persu@@ aded to block or delay regulations to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have resist@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when trying to delay implementing a rule of the Obama administration , which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn in O@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in earlier administr@@ ations , the EP@@ O has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then be accused of being accused of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EP@@ O stated that P@@ ru@@ itt would some@@ day use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more complete re @-@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 Rules for at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states , acc@@ uses EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health care system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ ction surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female Tum@@ bling Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the church , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische urn @-@ book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen and the &quot; vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document according to the document , in addition to the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged to and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still recognizable today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the most beautiful settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 support these historical facts .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval right of residence .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied it with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .
this was connected with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was broken at Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were inserted and the pieces of bell were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church mill and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the victims from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half crashed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the remaining tower @-@ tower remained as witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cher@@ ish the Hil@@ arius plant as the successor of Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , 16 July .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to the end of the seren@@ ade a trunk is taking place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers present the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ors and hearing impaired .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the boundary to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power @-@ concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a form error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the granted approval is still illegal and therefore also withdraw , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recogni@@ zing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been entered in the circle of Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her for the occasion to check the matter again .
they do not , however , lead to the fact that the proceedings are stopped .
in view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW Re , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NEW &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsidiary , plans to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed le@@ ases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ person households .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NEW Re &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to invest some 20 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was seriously wounded .
two more persons were injured easily .
the state road remained blocked for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch and her car accompanied her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer planning &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ berg and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping tour into the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ weekend is to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers for which offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves to their apprenticeship places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite the &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the promotion aims not only to the inhabitants of the city and the region .
in preparation there will be commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags indicating the action weekend , as Christian König .
the municipal administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive Down@@ town . &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first Active Day , well as a well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly opened or re@@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was time for King in the spring to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was spreading .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the nation &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities , took part for the first time .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and its many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

tr@@ ump added after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border dam
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , Tr@@ ump demanded to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president imp@@ elled him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to have Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump , Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform ra@@ cial ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged to block his path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates ho@@ ver in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es torn the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked off very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge have come back to im@@ itate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is truly incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post @-@ job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil servant .
for him , post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we need justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician lays a du@@ vet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding county were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching Process .
but none of them was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the ground for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people of Georgia to vote for their vote in the Pre @-@ election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com ob@@ serves a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they came from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in killing , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and if you vote , that will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and well @-@ founded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom want to believe that he does not exist in America any more .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t relate to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have under@@ gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief @-@ C@@ lan@@ co member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ un , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he is going away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
r@@ attle rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ un says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with sorrow , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays shi@@ mmer@@ ing lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice is breaking every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing humidity for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the C@@ lans member .
Nick Ras@@ un embra@@ ces two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
a white couple from Atlanta chat@@ ted at a table about the reproduction with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , the feeling that the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do this because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , eating and remin@@ ding the citizen &apos;s rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reproduction is in a way inspiring , for it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf uses a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as a rock energy , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which goes through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ aging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they se@@ duce Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , break a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the cra@@ ck@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the glorious nasty Hagen surrounding the aura of a gravity box .
brut@@ ally the scene , when Siegfried notices Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and lightly bowed his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ e , are celebrated in a stor@@ my way .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly anticipated by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 , when he had to let go of a thunder@@ ing concert of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation , in which the occasional &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been delighted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to be an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max Lot works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in a stone belt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in the open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences with this ?
amount : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a later professional volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I graduated from S@@ LC .
and then a degree in civil engineering , let &apos;s say , abor@@ ted successfully .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point perhaps too , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social engineering .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker education at Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the Fachhochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that provoked me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs off .
in other words than in civil engineering studies ?
amount : well , here it is not about calculating extras .
there are always other people in front of the head , each having a different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - one has to react individually to it .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will disman@@ tle another 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme is started to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the post @-@ 2018 job cuts , which Chief Executive Officer John Fall@@ on announced in the late 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 places have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost @-@ cutting program a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted an increase of 1 percent to 2.0@@ 5 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed on suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , told a statement by NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians were killed in the subur@@ b of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carried out by people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban away from power in 2001 .
the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump atten@@ ds to increase the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Administration has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states the states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 States compl@@ ained the Agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intent of EPA to determine the zone of o@@ zone - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to establish where cuts must be made in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump is supposed to boost economic growth .
however , efforts have provoked the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
common room wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the district council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to establish a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing plot is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
it will still take some time until the area belonging to the church community has been owned by the church community , but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a shared space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council ho@@ ver@@ ed not to fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting point only for the residents of sen@@ i@@ ority sitting , but openly entering the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget , is sweet@@ ened by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a joint space would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect no bil@@ lets should be thrown between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ - - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - would be possible as well as pitch roof - which reduces the height and makes construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the committee .
it is not that easy for the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; own buildings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which one does not move forward quite rightly , but they now lean in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
she sees behind it a cover@@ t payout to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but gets a real counter@@ value , which can be sold in case of doubt , is the counter@@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to apply the proposal accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from 12 : 20 in the direction of Hil@@ den on the way .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver who is moving in the same direction granted him preced@@ ence .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove onto the road , he obviously didn &apos;t look at the counter @-@ traffic .
he met a car , headed by a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching carriage .
FC Bayern Munich has to disp@@ ense with the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , staff members at the German Football Record Champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger at the podium winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin from Star to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the information needs of many visitors , it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in a first phase by 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
ask for St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be completed by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is considerably more distant .
I will also teach in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the midst of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail - the Plan@@ etary Trail - on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6,5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun that is exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting competition in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ac@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Spring Weight Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ di@@ visional world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday to Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How about you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ y@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ y@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ zer &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to fall down to lightweight .
and he must move on light weight forkli@@ fts &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ac@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ y@@ enko had to fight with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciate Lom@@ y@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ y@@ enko held a generous praise to Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side is &quot; very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to go off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded by tire plat@@ ter
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the gu@@ ise where he over@@ came and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured man by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 at the beginning of the season against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the first match of the season , with the result that the two opponents were not at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ part cycle is also to be further optimised .
and the For@@ tun@@ en also don &apos;t want to catch up with a goal after a kick @-@ off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be such that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that according to the experience in the preparation with the three chain , his team is better able to cope better than with the four @-@ chain chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to operate in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ lt , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not make so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after an un@@ decided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good start to the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing of that .
&quot; I did not judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ en , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ body and Hoffmann that the Au@@ e players might be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the visitors from the Rhin@@ eland go as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are swe@@ pt away , only because we have the right to go among the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ body , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as executive coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ body doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Evaluation Test published
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing tests last year .
they should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical retirement assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the evaluation of human biological maturity to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally speaking , you can say that the risk of evaluating a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
a seven @-@ ton concrete section on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Traffic at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work started at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red coloured stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to guarantee stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is an edge fixing , which is also used as operating mode .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will take place .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building farm building and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridge installations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the volcanic Eifel region ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a wide alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day , because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big campaign launch &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell .
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but is now taking place in the car park below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is present .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the leading organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reported that he tried to get such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking places available because of the Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church already built .
now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the square &apos;s square , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ P@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
there are around 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to hold their speeches .
the police presence was unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is time to clean up after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; hits classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have made solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of Jazz ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games mix to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this spring of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with their special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone whom I had recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered especially under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but during school time when she pre@@ fers to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dam@@ sel , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to stay in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I &apos;ll tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the Party change from Govern@@ ors Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us than working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the ban@@ ishment of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been cut off gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships starting on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ recruitment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in F@@ ritz@@ lar , North Hessen , some 1000 people of the two died in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the un@@ explained fall of the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ on@@ ers of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice they have achieved in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter on Thursday .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s prime minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trau@@ mer@@ ä@@ ste fell on roses , the relatives were arm in arm in the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ berger , commander of the regi@@ ment belonging to the soldiers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Prime Minister von der Le@@ yen did not show that the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral Church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and said it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession to his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik talked about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift new elections
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ liches Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the dissolution of the parliament was spoken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise of a Gre@@ ens parliam@@ ent@@ arians from their parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Party Member El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend to his group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be officially elected on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ur@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s trust from the prime minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ur@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself emphas@@ ised , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a black @-@ green tra@@ der .
the Gre@@ ens called for the def@@ aul@@ ted de@@ pu@@ ties to return their Land@@ tag mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they will return their Land@@ tag mandate , which they received via the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret El@@ ke T@@ ests &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead a foreign language pron@@ unciation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of El@@ ke T@@ ests of Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the withdrawal of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her injured vanity and fru@@ stration is her personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned o@@ aks ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer @-@ protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states issue the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all we know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now assume the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ public@@ ist is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has been immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the concern of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
like the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of 0.0@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do manufacturing plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , production operations are not directly responsible .
rather , they must face economic damage due to the alleged illegal practice of service companies .
as always , there is too little controversy in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and hand@@ ing over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be present are of crucial importance .
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
manufacturers , distributors and consumers are faced with a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this must work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are spe@@ edi@@ ly and completely enligh@@ tened .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ obstruc@@ ted expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign up and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs must pay a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must counter@@ act with legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and risk ru@@ ining themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentr@@ ating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini dropped out of the pres@@ idency in 2015 by the pres@@ idency , his successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continued to be shocked by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinfor@@ ce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the account of the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years of 4@@ 4.4 million euros will be exp@@ elled in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P Sanc@@ tions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million Euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from businesses connected with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ onian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be transferred to Qatar via payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador will be and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easily identified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s , announced on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following signature .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because it can be different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Scho@@ g@@ gi@@ supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y has made on board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end : the airline re@@ stores the order .
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed Scho@@ gg@@ it@@ boards up to 14 grams each year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
business insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but even more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y how many applicants there is in the new ten@@ ders .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y hopes to extend the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
the Swiss choc@@ ol@@ ates have been distributing the Swiss choc@@ ol@@ ates on board their flights since 2006 .
prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
Swiss made the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the first class customers are indul@@ ged in goo@@ dies from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in Business Class , passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge period ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the sketch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before its stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
by stepping on the core of the g@@ ags - middle aged actors play awesome children who will grow - nevertheless they managed to gain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the Wit@@ ch .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering @-@ pot principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ ies like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sh@@ akes the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character is rum@@ bling through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos; Sing@@ les &apos; mou@@ sta@@ che , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old cra@@ cker .
it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ tw@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives him a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice bags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , like Americans perhaps do it with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desp@@ airing propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , it is moving away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs .
attack on Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
in the process 15 convic@@ ts were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against this .
in addition , officials ordered large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating Kon@@ stanz against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand Master was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with a close relationship to the Italian Ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank &apos;s account .
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the alien register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigration centre register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the records , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including around 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 international immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false arrangements led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with expul@@ sion @-@ persons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age if they have entered the country .
this emerges from an internal paper issued by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF brings such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatened because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the municipal council meeting , the congregation acknowled@@ ges the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our bodies are laid out for it , and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Red Cross &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red Cross &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bach , for the cann@@ ed foods are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bach reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K grid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
in front of them Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ rel counted among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for each 50 donated blood donations .
half as many are booking Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ gel , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter added ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their life juice .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slow@@ down of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase this month , as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the coming years to raise the inflation raised by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the loan costs could possibly rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business package issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February , although it was said that now it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year , adjusted down@@ wards , are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in comparison with the forecast predicted in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 billion and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations for a rise in interest and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth will likely be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the recent inflation report has little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries because the tigh@@ tening is even worse before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; the in@@ comes policy , &quot; she added that wages would recover significantly by the end of her three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote which caused the collapse of the sound@@ track . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that transgres@@ sion in relation to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in whom the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which could reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called it a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , appropriate candidates will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered by a family doctor may also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medication this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ atively this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the completion of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ ress with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all seating and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art came into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposite , so that when you push the door , it is very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meter number of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate @-@ imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a Smith Street business , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family established je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - has about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court record states that Col@@ in has property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it .
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early ape @-@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970 &apos;s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to extend their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has provoked the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has with@@ held very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff Tr@@ um@@ ps plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence from the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his senior staff on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s White House that he wanted to fix : bad news that got into the president &apos;s hands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertisements are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the candidate was angry for unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sam N@@ un@@ berg &apos;s former electoral advisor in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i stated at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . OK .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his colleagues managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are trying repeatedly to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ ers of the advis@@ ers to bring doub@@ t@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously gave a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; have attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump gets . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the population &apos;s help will be asked and hoped .
in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals are sent to the police all over Europe .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday about the action followed by the winter on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting holiday destinations were hiding , it was called Euro@@ pol .
we have collected 21 post@@ cards for searched di@@ re@@ akers from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online brow@@ s have been arrested until now , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on a war foot that have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn from the municipality in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans in a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought together horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have bes@@ et Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of those travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and they even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps in order to move on as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal conduct to the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made of Birken@@ hof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently undergoing renovation and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also recei@@ pts due to the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rats@@ amt as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest in the house back then .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ yi with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has long been standing building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer talking to our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , the sh@@ aver emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with approximately 60 rooms , wants to be set wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , as sh@@ aver .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Thomas Sch@@ erer , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly according to the amount of investments .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be open to the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special promot@@ er sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee accepted the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to persons familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there are already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of target@@ ing themselves in the 2016 Pres@@ idential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ cans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and the accus@@ ation that the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine the present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide if charges are to be charged .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called anch@@ oring chambers .
they are usually switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to inter@@ ro@@ gate E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his principal campaign head Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also involved in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the enforcement showed that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
however , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme gives the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey has said three times that it is not going to be determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , the explanation continued .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump have become lou@@ der and have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , Com@@ ey said in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and his staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulation on whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idency of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democ@@ rat Sen@@ ators presented draft schemes on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could not be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has settled down from the ice shelf by the seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for man from him .
according to researchers , to what extent climate change has played a role in the ab@@ rup@@ ture of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
in the north of this circuit , the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf .
I am talking a lot about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can collapse if a piece is broken at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after the mel@@ tdown itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project writes to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the junction from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , it was disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ ho@@ e would grow again or go back in the long @-@ term and possibly collap@@ sed , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even though these researchers do not return the departure of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ mis@@ si@@ les of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collap@@ sed over the past few decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ c@@ tica stretches towards South America .
according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and is therefore one of the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants household tari@@ ff at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive .
only a short time before the summer break , 41 new jobs were entered into the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administrative district in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought after .
there were approximately 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 non @-@ occupied positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as general administration forces .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative jointly with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and oppose the lack of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wishes of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demands on skilled workers but to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented application scar@@ city .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent internally and externally , show concrete measures for newcom@@ ers and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know before .
other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition between the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete illness or age due to the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high time to act thus , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had long been anxi@@ ous for a bad surprise in the circle of his circle , when he publicly challenged the costs of personnel costs and struck the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be verified that allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a tari@@ ff , &quot; says peoples .
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better for the employees and officials when it actually pre@@ views the pay for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money exists only if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees concerned with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens tone on NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team worked effectively with human traders in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself as a detailed alleg@@ ation of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our highest priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian coast@@ guards , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer who controls their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign themselves , Nobel Prize @-@ winning organisation is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the b@@ ail@@ out measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , which meant that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Exter@@ iors &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the aforementioned levels .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , rewar@@ ding for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day he went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again , there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sports
will the sport stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium racing during wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long ago become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gi@@ ages included .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ liga associations , which are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that a number of clubs are still going on this train . &quot;
next weekend , the World Cup FIFA World Cup in London will organise the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than to send the Federal Office to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA were fought at competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which the professionals compete against each other .
and E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme at the Asian Games 2022 .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in the classic sport - e.g. increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientists positively highlight the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study conducted by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a rapid growth in the E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be at 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
internationally , many countries are already further .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
according to D@@ utt , the football first league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy crowd for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide by texts and calls .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June to a negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and eyes directed down@@ wards as she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she did not take any responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they absolutely regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there was &quot; no day I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , stated that she would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realisation that she would never participate in her brother &apos;s marriage or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the year 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; put yourself on , spring from a building , catch yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that by some press she should benefit from the fall .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
it is no coincidence that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm it .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made his arm close to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the level could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was made up of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the holiday , but he .
the best thing to do is to distribute sugar to those you want to keep in a good mood .
so those who have been chosen to take part in L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s heritage can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right rear , that is his position , the white bond on the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i worked in this initial release as the one who can best take the helm into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal there@@ with to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ kl@@ ed hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to get out of the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( collap@@ sed also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it not to drop in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
that , after all , worked very well .
in addition to Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy , Sü@@ le ran up against the defense , both acted effort@@ lessly .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often took a hard time , and Sü@@ ver also tried a few times successfully in the play @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also taken for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bavarian @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked after the game .
Ru@@ dy , for instance , did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cris@@ p statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of sweet@@ ness an interesting phrase : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you simply have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore .
aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ FB @-@ La@@ dies

Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has been reported to Twitter shortly before the game and wishes the Ö@@ FB @-@ Damen all the best .
the Bavarian legi@@ on@@ ary is a kind of club colleague of Ö@@ FB @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ en@@ Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our La@@ dies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and champi@@ ons League winner should be a special kind of motivation .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft lo@@ bt Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often unfor@@ giving , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than a year when the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request of change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ le the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s list of priorities .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 will be the construction law .
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Bureau of Transport .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann , the Minister of the Environment .
Nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aiming for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label , as prompted by Wis@@ sing , in order to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine expor@@ ter since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the Chamber of Commerce appro@@ ves .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passing of the master examination and 2500 euros , if graduates within ten years after the master training become self @-@ sufficient .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Trier Chamber of Commerce .
only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up Wis@@ sing at Landes@@ betrieb mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U spokesperson on calculations , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country , as it seeks to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics and is still on the board of directors of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field again after four months due to in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi aims to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the chairman of the BMW Group said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and he moved to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based - to forbi@@ d or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of har@@ sh@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen which have been able to regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car has been tested , but drive back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the study could be heavily loaded by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft through Munich , which has a special message , continues on Saturday Saturday .
if it goes to the Is@@ ar again on Saturday , there will be a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a nasty raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ran@@ box .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the start of an ou@@ tre@@ ach campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wild &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los dum@@ pl@@ ings and laughter against sorrow
at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested himself to be a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which he frustr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s : the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist was always inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he still works on the drawing table , works almost ten hours every day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , its cute figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his characters for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has an exchange @-@ bearer as a counter@@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather sits on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .
Provence &apos;s Lav@@ ender threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is falling due to the conditions which are reminiscent of d@@ rought and due to diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert on the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts tourists not only , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evap@@ oration of the evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1@@ th anniversary this year .
the highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval festival .
in these days shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ ants or a country house camp are to be experienced in the city centre .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings are enough .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected to stand on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from the violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ul@@ ating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 .
among the latter is the editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; justice &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wore t @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General was built in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only initiated two criminal proceedings .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itors .
without information on mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve Flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , gu@@ essed members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez could not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she was leading .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the CP@@ J Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for the routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , keep away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where staff from Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones were allowed . days before it was known that sp@@ y@@ ware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size area of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the cul@@ let , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers , whom the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have entered the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has written on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous writer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corrupt cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had seen the Val@@ dez column as the best @-@ informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez leaves Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth .
she has asked since then that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media campaign group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; allocated more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ el with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , agrees that drug traffi@@ cking will frigh@@ ten him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vet riv@@ als and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens lift up nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine called it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
Sha@@ wn Funk was found on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something out of the surrounding rock out of place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy oil shr@@ unk .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it had slept , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as a counter @-@ shade , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arms over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ad@@ owing , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the account sh@@ ad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs are hun@@ ted by enough pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal contents , to find out what he ate as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ Flo@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther inland as they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but is preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .
even though the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved arm@@ oured Din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures on average were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the cr@@ ates still cover up bul@@ ging arm@@ oured panels along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is so &apos; rare as a winning in the lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass collision .
there are numerous wounded , kilometers long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the expres@@ s@@ way Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people have been injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , between the junction points Adel@@ hei@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , about 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other .
there is no information about the exact number of injured persons .
it was a light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long reserve was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z @-@ repor@@ ter , there was also a lot of g@@ aff@@ er on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory to massive disabilities .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was the hall@@ mark of the vehicle manufacturers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing escap@@ es in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
if the conductor comes and w@@ akes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the paper@@ less ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket evaluation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway .
you also have to buy it through the app of the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : you step into the train , invo@@ ke your ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test customers .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket control at place Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue sleeping , working on , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail@@ road - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ d@@ ants simply check in in the DB navig@@ ator .
this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second advantage : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you do not have all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document to be presented .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other issues .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one else posted the information in their feed , she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people crying out and being a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l reminded herself of her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance , which is made up of people &apos;s point of view who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating and eating health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tor@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l into the mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as follows recently in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ Tra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other local people was the Team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are presented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show unexpected personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , as she falls in love with her and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tor@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ tive type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , even though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial relationships between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping m@@ all at the south end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves the subject cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , and the rest of the shops also profit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the plot where the farmers market hall is located , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction works will be finished .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a square with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the farmers market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women love again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I don &apos;t think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
one can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important for us to keep at least the Mark@@ thalle .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping center because the rent there is often not portable to a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of them will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market be moving during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit @-@ gallery actually comes in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery already manage to sell all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this simply won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to have a real farmer market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown that are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after being secretly classified as secret diplomatic messages on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was turned by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward since her pu@@ ber@@ ty openly talked about the identification of women , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum bl@@ ond wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette stum@@ ps and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained M@@ use became un@@ equal spectac@@ les , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform her judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven more brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government bearing and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to remedy .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been in her family name . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
with the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in organic terms , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , are also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic book .
it shows Mann@@ ing , how she appears with a hands @-@ on phone in the hand of the disciplinary ci@@ ci@@ ary of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they chill your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which meet like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious residential apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them should now be in absence and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them reinfor@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the occup@@ ants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s timetable to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the matter , mut@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we won &apos;t admit anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one pre@@ tends to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of the WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs anymore
these divided the company groups .
it was a pure precau@@ tion that no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ous anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the look@@ out to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Mr Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys from specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers exhibit low appro@@ vals - so that you can re@@ bo@@ ke why .
companies come to see that they have to remain at the forefront of work culture so that you will not be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulatory and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial @-@ engineered site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
scent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently , u@@ ber has registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line which allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the Chief Financial Officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed faster - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will hold the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding from companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
sparkling US $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners secured its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that demonstrates that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees about your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has looked too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t follow , people wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so saving .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is gaining new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your company .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ players conver@@ se on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually length@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood conducted practical exercises .
they should have 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the N@@ CA@@ A rules , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put on it this enormous burden three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ick further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practice once the camp is finished , which is not an easy task in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ aka Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked off with foot@@ balls , which is a safety net behind a door@@ post .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then hire them to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on car park 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors that may display results of the fact check from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan on which social media networks should be punished if they fail to clear hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook announced in a separate statement that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts @-@ review was started .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fact @-@ beating parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest ) this seems to be all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &apos; new &apos; castle , to explore the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ apers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who possessed what : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch that fought two families .
guys , let everything go their way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century portra@@ yed his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite nau@@ ghty , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to advertise land@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must be done with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle v@@ aul@@ ted in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
the city of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday with the closure of the old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the campaign since yesterday on the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their website , which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
in essence , we are convinced that in Bad Honne@@ f we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the action it is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other communities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) in Ankara advises on retirement and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine among Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as in former times , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the deliber@@ ations took place under the head of the head of government , including five Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
this resulted in the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved immediately in the coup attempt , this week is being negotiated in Ankara .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the ban on soldiers for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the great deal in the army and the security forces goes on anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 public servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times they appeal to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
ex @-@ officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly unknown officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt , sought asylum , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ge in the deployment of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it intends to reduce legal Immig@@ rants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two Cham@@ bers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens are spending Green Cards like citizens from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the present system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race @-@ gate @-@ shuttle
again and again over the past few months the future of the race ticket has been cont@@ ested - now it should be quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is to be built on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated track on which the tourist railway goes .
in order to secure the future of the race ticket in the long term , construction works on the track are to begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this connection most important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Minister of Transport Klaus Pun@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the repair of the route was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the Shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , will be fin@@ alised at the moment , declared atonement .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gian railway as operator agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said atonement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
during the course of a pilot operation , a pilot plant has been tested over the past few months to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people in order to re @-@ order them regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ auf@@ äl@@ lig .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we &apos;ll get them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables its users , for example , to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy Gold @-@ Ro@@ bot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in the mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ usion to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : re@@ pul@@ sive ) Far@@ rah , worry one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men then have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origins and their growing refin@@ ement point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most males will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their growing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the fr@@ ing@@ es can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has argued that women have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most terri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the sli@@ pped body and the st@@ och@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; robots do not represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the saying of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of sound human understanding
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were papers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump voting relatives .
we all re@@ port@@ edly strain all of us to let our filter bags burst .
less noted is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly appeared on the same side .
for the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but I find myself in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the working effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the gri@@ ev@@ ous possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer exp@@ el us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the Right wing , which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime .
when pumping goes , the next Republi@@ can candidate must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest car@@ ous@@ el of the New York Park Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I still am not quite beyond the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the them@@ ed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a magical experience , as here two @-@ year old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it afterwards .
on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood horri@@ bly angry while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts in his wrist which he suffered from the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ door vessels were dischar@@ ged from bas@@ ins and ice ho@@ ops in the vac@@ ations and in the secondary schools .
three of the school students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band performed a musical called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Farm of the hen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and had it hat@@ ched by his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders wore to make the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ person @-@ person that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a thank @-@ word to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps into school trips , and the parents &quot; representatives .
now the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she only dis@@ likes her students after two years of teaching , because it has been a really great time .
finally , they were able to rely on the four @-@ door vessels .
at the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .
in the process , great joy broke out among the children .
for the new school year there are already eight first @-@ wat@@ chers registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained in Greece because of illegal camps , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by TV .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place significant fin@@ es for anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its retro@@ fitting has ordered the German Federal Office of Transport ( Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date .
Daimler reported to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long should the change@@ over be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to tell , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive fall in prices of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is currently no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
awards are presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will be hosting a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will take part in the award ceremony .
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar , who was announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would wai@@ ve the participation at the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year .
the position is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a City Engineer for the last thirty years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he conve@@ ys in the press talk .
he reports about varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has ever been able to fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way , considering the regular periods of notice , there should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach functions as a lower building rights authority for the administration community , the applicant has to show corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to the conference until Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated , which the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park grounds are about to be found .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will book with approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a large play room for a city builder .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own farm and nur@@ sery , many things can be re@@ acted very flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old@@ town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is fit &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphasizes .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears a high degree of responsibility in any case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs here above my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on long@@ standing employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor too long , and W@@ acker wants himself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , those who wish to bury Roland W@@ acker should have a degree in degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to high and civil engineering , construction supervision , underground management , management of urban real estate , Municipal depot with building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as Lower Construction Law Authority including Monument Protection .
bike on lines thrown : South railway track locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators threw the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and have been looking for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a red sco@@ oter and a bicycle rider were watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a city in Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators themselves would have brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail replacement traffic , the railway @-@ customers could still count on the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is to be dealt with , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern railway line could be continued without any disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were dischar@@ ged Friday morning , two of which concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products may allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ats , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant col@@ on .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflamm@@ ations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without har@@ ming sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el movement if the same system also works in humans .
post @-@ doctoral research Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been separated , however , did not .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed to &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen roll when people like Paul Pog@@ gi@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
but matic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho ad@@ mits that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to M@@ atic , also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho used his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have done great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the Boeing aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no be@@ ac@@ ons from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - that was the most important wish of the elec@@ tive warri@@ ors .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U general secretary Peter Tau@@ ber from the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the start@@ ling faction of a Gre@@ ens Euro MP threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apost@@ ate Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ests to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election winner si@@ ghs when Friday morning the new job message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands since the transition from El@@ ke T@@ westen &apos;s green de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U without his own government majority .
it is the preliminary peak of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades re@@ assure themselves at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it then became - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into p@@ its , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
the comrades res@@ or@@ ted in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just drawn new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next depression .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ sh@@ ef , lost his j@@ Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in the communication of crisis afterwards what could be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l has been trying to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings .
they allowed him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because of this , Wei@@ l is no fault of the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at the time , comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Ms T@@ westen places their own career goals on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the lower @-@ Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vot@@ er four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career path of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for center stage III
those who would like to renov@@ ate his house in the years can receive support from the country in the near future .
mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed them on Wednesday in emotion .
at the beginning of the information session Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 there have been some areas of rehabilitation .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg assumed another two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the renovation projects are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to promote internal development and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I received the information from the Karlsruhe Government Pres@@ idency that there will be a renewal area III .
the total amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros came from the country , the rest of the commune felt .
how does a refur@@ bish@@ ment area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , says Sch@@ in@@ dler , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role in rehabil@@ it@@ ating interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basement presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the funding period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the assessment would only be carried out once , within the framework of which those involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , as far as possible the constitution of the sentence is to take place so that the renovation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each Commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
it is a question of evaluating and deciding on urban planning and to decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
then there will be a re@@ mark in the land register for the property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after feeling and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project is a key success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real estate and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is among other things about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on the size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to promoting .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first , first grin@@ ds .
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location nucle@@ us II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been shown to make a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country to be equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an Ac@@ es@@ thesi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and only lasts 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military specification provided to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut Hel@@ icop@@ ter was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wisconsin fire engine and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi For@@ kli@@ ft .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of the nav@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew was required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground by plane during the time .
it was not clear from the notes provided by TI@@ ME if a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could inj@@ ure the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a push for reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is unlikely to be a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential plane served against the backdrop of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters , Vice President of the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs of the air@@ crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter out on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget awards for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky task
the championship leader of the second tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga is runner @-@ up in the third quarter Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow morning from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel , at the stand@@ ings of the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games of still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress included a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft seems to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from the O@@ MV are concerned , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Region North Stream 2 with other European companies .
the dr@@ one is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring the sanctions even per Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the corporation could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest fashion shows of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the world &apos;s rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ bic ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .

role revers@@ ing : the city has 46 kitchen subsidies
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch@@ time again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in urban day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth aid department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cook continues to cook out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh chill@@ ed chill@@ ed .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 week@@ days are eating at the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , give off the meal , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sev@@ ent@@ een units - decides over the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has presented itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign awar@@ ding for the city as the most economical way it is from the press office .
and that although 46 partial @-@ time powers are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with around 750 people in the training area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , the official leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council &apos;s election in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tali@@ ban have published threats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the elections for the first time will hand the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ som , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A strong role for women will reinfor@@ ce Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the police information , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who was staying with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , against 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpet@@ rators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , but this failed .
the duo escaped without prey .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments at the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
for managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union wants to make sure that it has a long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; expressing concern that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not promoted . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the prospect of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
one spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value continuous commitment among employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with co @-@ workers and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continually review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and completely . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t let N@@ ey@@ mar follow after an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sensational approach has raised the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ gi@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , though a source near the Catalan Executive Board is insist@@ ing that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world been warned of the prospect of the PS@@ G three years ago ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we &apos;ll contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW arrived on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au a car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to escape to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
damage was made on the car .
the driver of the car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it may well be that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the ab@@ uses reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication in relation to the German Press Agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bischof and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false assessment of the events at that time .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that when reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen area , it was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the habit of referring to the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like going on to the church and that &apos;s a found fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows had been a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finish with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with the reports of the ab@@ uses , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who recorded with R@@ atz@@ inger the souvenir book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 page report presented by the Regensburg @-@ based lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of assault , 67 dom@@ es of sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is written by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by cath@@ eter masters R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , unlike many others , many victims claim that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has rati@@ fied his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of abuse of victims of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on one hand , many students emphasize their humanity .
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible for the former when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally did not produce top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
it is possible to blame him at all , to experience it too late or not to have taken the first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes it as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; was always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains of its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to break@@ through@@ s .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just kno@@ ck on chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also distributed ear cow@@ ards and over@@ ly che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he had admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his res@@ cu@@ ing , however , it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the late 1960s , 1960s , and 1970s , both with parents and teachers .
do you still know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the primary school , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly excav@@ at@@ elles .
one is wondering if it is not more likely to do with his not@@ ori@@ ety and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
at the Bavarian Pope many who have never understood him are still busy .
but the truth is : the report bur@@ dened Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , a lot was reported in the context of the report on abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also accused of involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted itself to the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the afflicted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem of educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and brothers , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators in a professional manner .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it is absurd ... even for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben have opened more urgently and more clearly or more clearly than against their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not possible to confirm that the student and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance , but could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ operation .
he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these contradictory crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much to read about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forci@@ ble exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cath@@ eter Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the primary school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , any other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were rig@@ ged and mal@@ ol@@ ored and suffered from it , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , as most witnesses stress , the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories connect with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the alleg@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he was beginning to establish himself and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear , and then back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the primary school the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were forbidden in Bavaria as well .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was not until the year 1980 that the test penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right now .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond what was customary at the time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it finally works .
but at the same time I must take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so to pull ear@@ ring and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played with you in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of test penalty come to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , from his perspective , that the Dom@@ spar@@ rows only played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not at all deny that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and goo@@ dies alone , one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success , regardless of whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
as for a person , did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger talking to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and hear@@ ty people , from which one can not imagine that he could do something only for a fly .
I regularly receive how many former dom@@ es still have contact with him today , 23 years after his expul@@ sion , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who have not forgiven him to this day , that he once was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ es are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and made them close to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they almost worship .
and please , again , clearly : all that you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , all too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the advoc@@ ate would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
