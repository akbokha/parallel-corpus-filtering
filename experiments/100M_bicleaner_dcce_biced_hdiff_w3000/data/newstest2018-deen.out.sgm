<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where youngsters are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the erstwhile ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car navigation system instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - yet very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large map of the map, detailed maps, so-called "composition sheets" were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first survey in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally moved away with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is most impressive by the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was introduced 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Saxony were concentrated around 1856 along the today's plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming there appears a smaller-scale card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered pieces from the so-called "uranium" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots do not occupy any farmers there today - but small gardeners of the" "" "land in sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the composition paper, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lünen" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once closed people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich County Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Ventilation" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was in charge of the establishment of a psychiatrist in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the anchor of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "moreover, he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occupants," "" "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet now on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and moved it to a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected - in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Head Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a mining chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn family route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farables has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racial attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls upon Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state and take extreme caution because a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately aim at minorities, prompted the group to publish the warning message, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri General Prosecutor Office, which shows that 75 percent of black motorists are being employed as whites in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be prepared if they bring a deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classify the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-wing court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU location met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens provided and lodged in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, such as Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales come to the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the chairman of the" "" "Fischbach" "", "he described the electric fence project as" "" "essential." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot produce profitably on such steep areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer even if he did not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticised for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of maintenance is 40 hectares, which may not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded by leader, a quarter carried by the community of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the durability of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it's not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss it was clear:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape care line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor set specified by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be enclosed must not be tuppery (slope tilt above 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fischbacher Weidezfence project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of maintenance corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump sums up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals on the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty Imitators would have done it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta wrote," "" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the eleventh fall of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the will they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not enlighten the way, but to ignite the hatred that is her only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as a team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads along this path and last year set five British and two European records.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics via Facebook: do not mess about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He slipped in at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was complaining of him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as" "" "Frivol" "", "and the online comment was full of a backlash with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He obtained the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not full of hate, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I do not like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some more as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the governor described as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical disguises or arrest demonstrators and silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County made the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable servings had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck him.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticised his position on the treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overpowered his ministry, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines never tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA CEO Pruitt retires because of the failure of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities more responsive than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a term that expired on 1 October for States to meet the 2015 standards for ozone near soil.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay adherence to a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump Attorney of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been persuaded to block or delay regulations to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have resisted.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda." ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when trying to delay implementing a rule of the Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his turn in Ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "in earlier administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then be accused of being accused of activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPO stated that Pruitt would someday use his "authority to delay and all other legally available authority" to ensure that the provisions "are based on solid politics and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more complete re-constitution of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 Rules for at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states, accuses EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Female Tumbling Celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the church, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and promoters of tumours their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische urn-book: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the" vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document according to the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged to and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still recognizable today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the most beautiful settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 support these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from the early medieval right of residence.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied it with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was connected with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was broken at Christmas in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were inserted and the pieces of bell were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church mill and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the victims from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the remaining tower-tower remained as witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cherish the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumlingens invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "Hartmut Romann" "" "speaks the final word." ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade a trunk is taking place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers present the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumors and hearing impaired.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirmed.</seg>

<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim wears" "" "asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only at the boundary to Schwalmtal a wind power-concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="511">Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a form error.</seg>

<seg id="518">They do not, however, lead to the fact that the proceedings are stopped.</seg>

<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-person households.</seg>
<seg id="523">"" "the" "" "NEW Re" "" "wants to invest some 20 million euros." ""</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">In September, Bad Langensalzberg and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to entice the inhabitants to the shopping tour into the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" -weekend is to sensitize the customers for which offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket-goods.</seg>
<seg id="535">A market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic companies should present themselves to their apprenticeship places.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite the "midnight shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">The promotion aims not only to the inhabitants of the city and the region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation there will be commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags indicating the action weekend, as Christian König.</seg>

<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be newly opened or reopened.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many local people would have lost the city center while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was time for King in the spring to overcome lethargy with a network that was spreading.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühlhausen, announced that the nation's third "home-shopping" day, five Thuringian cities, took part for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="550">Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max Lot works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work at several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in a stone belt in the furniture market, once a week I help here in Greven at the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at the school in the open all-day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with this?</seg>
<seg id="687">Amount: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a later professional volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I graduated from SLC.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a degree in civil engineering, let's say, aborted successfully.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, at the focal point perhaps too, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">In the winter semester, I will start my studies in social engineering.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably do a social worker education at Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the Fachhochschule.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Amount: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It probably depends on where you make your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that provoked me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs off.</seg>
<seg id="708">In other words than in civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="709">Amount: well, here it is not about calculating extras.</seg>
<seg id="710">There are always other people in front of the head, each having a different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager who has been taken out of the family - one has to react individually to it.</seg>

<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>

<seg id="895">When the Newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of the medical retirement assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves the evaluation of human biological maturity to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.</seg>

<seg id="903">Full in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">A seven-ton concrete section on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach was installed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it works great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Building and Traffic at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work started at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red coloured stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to guarantee stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.30 m wide and seven tonnes heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fixing, which is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway will take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building farm building and the collecting point in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light lane.</seg>
<seg id="928">"" "the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels" "" "Tannenhof" "" "and" "" "Seven Linden" "" "is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance." ""</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the volcanic Eifel region (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, left) are part of a wide alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD invites Rondell to the "big campaign launch" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell.</seg>
<seg id="934">And well-known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch.</seg>

<seg id="947">There is also a band for entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz, in the Stadthalle several speakers, among them the Rhineland-Pälzische AfD-chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">There are around 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence was unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour is the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is time to clean up after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unobstructed expenditures of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose for Neymar to sign up and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the energy-rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs must pay a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must counteract with legitimate income sources that allow them the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risk ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "during the current three-year" "" "FFP" "" "period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini dropped out of the presidency in 2015 by the presidency, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continued to be shocked by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely, FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the account of the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years of 44.4 million euros will be expelled in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP Sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, hit the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million Euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from businesses connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalonian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be transferred to Qatar via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar's World Cup ambassador will be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easily identified.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymars, announced on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's final ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new Schoggisupplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolate Frey has made on board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end: the airline restores the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white packed Schoggitboards up to 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Business insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But even more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious job for a shooter manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss doesn't want to betray how many applicants there is in the new tenders.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article, Chocolat Frey hopes to extend the contract over the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1173">The Swiss chocolates have been distributing the Swiss chocolates on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Prior to signing a contract with Migros daughter Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss made the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long haul flights the first class customers are indulged in goodies from the Sprüngli Confiserie, in Business Class, passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year-Grunge period (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Showalter the sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001 before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By stepping on the core of the gags - middle aged actors play awesome children who will grow - nevertheless they managed to gain the impossibility of winning the last part of the Witch.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults, is less emotional rooted and his parody goes more after the watering-pot principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90-ies like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that shakes the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "at one point, a character is rumbling through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, excourses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons' Singles' moustache, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its East-West-West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gattwood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director gives him a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice bags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on television, like Americans perhaps do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes a decent play 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a despairing propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it is moving away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "rade Detective" "", "which was edited on a smaller length, could better deliver its Agitprop Satire, since Gregory and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a forage for money.</seg>

<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In the process 15 convicts were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against this.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, officials ordered large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the case of simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>

<seg id="1218">In the action Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bankress with a passion for real estate, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in Knightsbridge with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my requirement," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all seating and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art came into it," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is opposite, so that when you push the door, it is very easy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the floor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meter number of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate-imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a Smith Street business, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family established jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that Colin has property worth $316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affiridavit.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early ape-vit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases, with hundreds of pages with affiridavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held by law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970's.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to extend their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, where Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul says," "" "has provoked the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has withheld very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case was before the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Trumps plans to limit the media abstinence from the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his senior staff on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted to fix: bad news that got into the president's hands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertisements are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if the candidate was angry for unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said Sam Nunberg's former electoral advisor in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri stated at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps's Twitter habit under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that trumps tweets would have included even more combustibles without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his colleagues managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are trying repeatedly to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the advisers of the advisers to bring doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump-officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicans, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "have attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump gets."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made up of the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently undergoing renovation and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also receipts due to the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest in the house back then.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenyi with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. special promoter sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the committee accepted the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "referring to persons familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of targeting themselves in the 2016 Presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a close look at more and more Trumps's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special promoter Trump had personally moved into the centre and the accusation that the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine the present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide if charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called anchoring chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite people to interrogate Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps's advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his principal campaign head Paul Manafort were also involved in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the enforcement showed that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme gives the democrats a chance to "feel good" because they have nothing else they can talk about. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not going to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, the explanation continued.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rationale, accusations against trump have become louder and have hindered the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey said in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation on whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democrat Senators presented draft schemes on Thursday, after which the special promoter could not be dismissed so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the north of this circuit, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am talking a lot about the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can collapse if a piece is broken at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after the meltdown itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the junction from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelseshoe would grow again or go back in the long-term and possibly collapsed, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not return the departure of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-missiles of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed over the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and is therefore one of the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants household tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU calls on the Employers' Association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only a short time before the summer break, 41 new jobs were entered into the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the administrative district in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were approximately 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 non-occupied positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as general administration forces.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative jointly with the FDP and UWG and oppose the lack of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the" "" "wishes of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demands on skilled workers but to counteract future-oriented application scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient internally and externally, show concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a regular" "" "competition between the public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who excrete illness or age due to the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">"" "" "" "high time to act thus, so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied." ""</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been anxious for a bad surprise in the circle of his circle, when he publicly challenged the costs of personnel costs and struck the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be verified that allow an exit from the municipal employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a tariff," says peoples.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay better for the employees and officials when it actually previews the pay for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money exists only if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees concerned with the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least, by the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>

<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat to the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team worked effectively with human traders in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself as a detailed allegation of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our highest priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in an opinion on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can shut down so that ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian coastguards, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who controls their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about" "" "significant changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the bailout measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and co-operation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berliner Exteriors" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Northern Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the aforementioned levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, rewarding for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day he went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, there was a lookout point at the lookout point, connected by "flew" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days many altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sport stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium racing during wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long ago become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high giages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first Bundesliga associations, which are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"" "" "" "real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people still go into the stadium in the future," "" "says the 52-year-old." ""</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than to send the Federal Office to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as League Of legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation FIFA were fought at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And E-Sport is already part of the official programme at the Asian Games 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobous has been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in the classic sport - e.g. increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the diet.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study conducted by Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be at 130 million.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is falling due to the conditions which are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert on the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small cichade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are very many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce normally meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected to stand on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is the editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wore t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Attorney General's Attorney General was built in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more traitors.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, "says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelve Flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, guessed members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to the newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was that Valdez could not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the establishment of Riodoce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "was his love for the routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the" "" "Riodoce Andres Villarreal," "" "said," "" "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggled smuggled, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where staff from Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones were allowed. days before it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the cullet, some of the reporters asked if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers, whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have entered the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has written on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous writer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to state expenditures focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corrupt cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had seen the Valdez column as the best-informed source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "we used to have known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office became a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on walkways and constructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez leaves Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media campaign group "Articulo 19" allocated more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because you want you to hold your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something out of the surrounding rock out of place, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it had slept," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured Dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique, which is known as a counter-shade, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arms over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shadowing, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the account shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs are hunted by enough pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the chalk time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence about his life, including his conserved intestinal contents, to find out what he ate as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South-Floorida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther inland as they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Even though the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs were hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six ton heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured Dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures on average were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the crates still cover up bulging armoured panels along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is so 'rare as a winning in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening at the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass collision.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometers long Staus and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the expressway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people have been injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, between the junction points Adelheihausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, about 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There is no information about the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a light to moderate injury, said a police spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich, a ten-kilometer long reserve was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported by an AZ-reporter, there was also a lot of gaffer on the trajectory to massive disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade was the hallmark of the vehicle manufacturers, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing escapes in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: mufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">If the conductor comes and wakes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently tests the paperless ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "if the offer comes, we expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it will probably be available at many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "" "said a railway speaker." ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "" "" "comfort Check-in" "" "calls the train ticket evaluation without conductor." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: one needs a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to buy it through the app of the train, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you step into the train, invoke your ticket under "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic devaluation appears in the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant arrives at the ticket control at place Y, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue sleeping, working on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railroad - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants simply check in in the DB navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train, "says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing management board.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second advantage:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you do not have all the documents you need to degrade online tickets in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document to be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one's own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other issues.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from High School.</seg>

<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She dropped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people crying out and being a man who claimed to be Browns's father who bore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance, which is made up of people's point of view who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell, with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, came to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism totally changed after August 9," "" "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority student Nurses Association and focused on eating and eating health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2059">"" "Torayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came Ferrell into the mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as follows recently in an interview," "" "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around TodeTrakt inmates.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show unexpected personal aspects of Ferris's life, as she falls in love with her and marries her wife." ""</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian area splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly leaves the subject cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, and the rest of the shops also profit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the plot where the farmers market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction works will be finished.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I don't think it's superfluous.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a weekly market here, it is all the more important for us to keep at least the Markthalle.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping center because the rent there is often not portable to a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of them will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>

<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market be moving during the construction period?</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown that are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after being secretly classified as secret diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was turned by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data could look like a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward since her puberty openly talked about the identification of women, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blond wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained Muse became unequal spectacles, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform her judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven more brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government bearing and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been in her family name."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">With the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in organic terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, are also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic book.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, how she appears with a hands-on phone in the hand of the disciplinary ciciary of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacres, which meet like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's timetable to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-integration of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>

<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in reference to the matter, mutko said," "" "We carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made an error." ""</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the lookout to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to address surveys, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Mr Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers exhibit low approvals - so that you can reboke why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to remain at the forefront of work culture so that you will not be the next Uber involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulatory and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial-engineered site Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Scent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Recently, uber has registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the Chief Financial Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion has grasped the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed faster - like discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employee Engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that will hold the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Sparkling US $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners secured its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that demonstrates that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only missions.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees about your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough or not at all, this can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has looked too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "if you don't follow, people wonder," "" "Did you really hear me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you take care of it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why I should?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so saving.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirement and transport in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine among Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff, as in former times, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The deliberations took place under the head of the head of government, including five Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This resulted in the number of civilians in the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan 169 has fired the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who have been involved immediately in the coup attempt, this week is being negotiated in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated the coup attempt as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse the armed forces."</seg>

<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unease in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">On the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the ban on soldiers for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The great deal in the army and the security forces goes on anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 public servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly known as the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they appeal to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for race-gate-shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Again and again over the past few months the future of the race ticket has been contested - now it should be quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, it is to be built on the dilapidated track on which the tourist railway goes.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race ticket in the long term, construction works on the track are to begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"" "" "" "with the decision to further order and renovate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country commits itself to this connection most important for tourism," "" "explained Minister of Transport Klaus Punl on Friday in Erfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost for the repair of the route was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country is 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on whose basis the Shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country, will be finalised at the moment, declared atonement.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even crazier in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we'll get them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepper woman look progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot enables its users, for example, to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxxy Gold-Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality, "enthuses True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in the mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusion to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: repulsive) Farrah, worry one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men then have Roxxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origins and their growing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most males will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their growing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the fringes can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has argued that women have been sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Maidservant ') are not the graphic images, the slipped body and the stoched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "robots do not represent real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the saying of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as the epitome of sound human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-wisdom of the trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were papers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump voting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all reportedly strain all of us to let our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-minded poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly appeared on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but I find myself in another context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the working effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "trump" "", "we refer to the grievous possibility that one day his kittens will no longer expel us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republican of the Right wing, which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards as an epitome of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When pumping goes, the next Republican candidate must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city, if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perpendicular music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I still am not quite beyond the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a magical experience, as here two-year old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood horribly angry while I wearied the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was hospitalized due to the treatment of cuts in his wrist which he suffered from the prison authorities in a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">After an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of the Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nightly intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs City Engineer, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The position is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a City Engineer for the last thirty years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports about varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that no application has ever been able to fulfil the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way, considering the regular periods of notice, there should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach functions as a lower building rights authority for the administration community, the applicant has to show corresponding degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to the conference until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products may alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloats, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant colon.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>

<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movement if the same system also works in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Post-doctoral research Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been separated, however, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>

<seg id="2850">GMB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross location.</seg>

<seg id="2863">Did PSG Barcelona warn of Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The page of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't let Neymar follow after an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has raised the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Poggiba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, though a source near the Catalan Executive Board is insisting that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world been warned of the prospect of the PSG three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">"" "but if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2880">Because he had a car in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and toured the guard rail.</seg>
<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW arrived on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of the outskirts of Stolzenau a car came to meet him in his lane, so that he had to escape to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">The Touran driver toured the guard rail.</seg>
<seg id="2884">Damage was made on the car.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The driver of the car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.</seg>
<seg id="2886">According to the accident damaged, it may well be that the Mercedesdriver had not noticed the accident at all.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuses relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," announced after publication in relation to the German Press Agency, he acquired an apology from former Regensburger Bischof and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that when reporting on violence in the Domspatzen area, it was measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is" "" "shameful and shameful acts" "", "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" "" "degree of media manipulation" "", "says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of referring to the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like going on to the church and that's a found fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows had been a normal educational tool" "" "to finish with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "it is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the abuses, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who recorded with Ratzinger the souvenir book "My brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take protection from Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440 page report presented by the Regensburg-based lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of assault, 67 domes of sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," "" "with high plausibility." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is written by Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by catheter masters R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "however, unlike many others, many victims claim that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger has ratified his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of abuse of victims of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On one hand, many students emphasize their humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became tangible for the former when a Domspatz musically did not produce top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to blame him at all, to experience it too late or not to have taken the first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium gymnasium on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally -" "" "redemption," "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes it as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "was always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains of its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to breakthroughs.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just knock on chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also distributed ear cowards and overly cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he had admitted even years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his rescuing, however, it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the late 1960s, 1960s, and 1970s, both with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the primary school, these are admittedly excavatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One is wondering if it is not more likely to do with his notoriety and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope many who have never understood him are still busy.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report burdened Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot was reported in the context of the report on abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted itself to the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said one of the afflicted," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem of educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and brothers, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it is absurd... even for really absurd to assume that... Buben have opened more urgently and more clearly or more clearly than against their parents, internats, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "it was not possible to confirm that the student and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, but could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these contradictory crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much to read about" "" "forcible excesses" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former catheter Georg Ratzinger is accused of being" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the primary school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, any other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were rigged and malolored and suffered from it, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the other hand, as most witnesses stress, the topic" "" "preschool" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories connect with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the allegation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he was beginning to establish himself and from his predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "that in the primary school the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were forbidden in Bavaria as well.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was not until the year 1980 that the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was customary at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it finally works.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take protection from Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, so to pull earring and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger played with you in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test penalty come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, that the Domsparrows only played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all deny that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and goodies alone, one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success, regardless of whatever area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As for a person, did you experience Georg Ratzinger talking to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and hearty people, from which one can not imagine that he could do something only for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive how many former domes still have contact with him today, 23 years after his expulsion, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he once was stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domes are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and made them close to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look up today and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again, clearly: all that you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the media scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the advocate would stop, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
