&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who earlier worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he was a friendly person with a great heart .
joining his family with his family was always cooking something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother that sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always stuck in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not have to be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glued from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ ug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress most likes to spend their time at home , in front of a TV with a lo@@ cker@@ el de@@ bris and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the white @-@ gl@@ ut brings them the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they drove home to the for@@ age in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at that pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and then the riding car@@ er then ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he let his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear for photo @-@ purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards for the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , silver bay leaf , champi@@ ons tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only granted for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 outstanding athletes , the double US Champion was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the conductor Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the ski@@ er Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society went to the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates are not at all in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump does not want to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to drive the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will greatly reduce regulations , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and therefore needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must invest in that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost verb@@ ati@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical party of the Republi@@ cans .
so on Tr@@ ump , party @-@ internal discussions could come to an end .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more apparent .
Tr@@ ump intends to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re@@ boot coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in areas protected so far , it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment programme Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energy and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , however , both are not willing to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs .
they are to be paid better , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7,@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump does in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to get up , then he says he cannot be changed .
but the large discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics are suggest@@ ing him that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
fle@@ eing : &quot; every fled woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social services in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ ow@@ ls .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ vot@@ ees for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - either not as visitors either .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence in her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope for Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for fle@@ eing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water , is no r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , er@@ r , tells B@@ ahr .
here , too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters are often considered inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the North of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations only for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or their own homes in some community shel@@ ters , only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since getting around that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
general Prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers Stri@@ king : demands For New Work Camp@@ aig@@ n
Deputy assistants have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes with respect to a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the treaty .
resident and medical students have agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; on what led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board today provided a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns starting in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors stro@@ ked six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA Regi@@ stra@@ r , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , indicating that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
following the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed flu@@ ffy and it hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for its restra@@ ined relations .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report , five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if nothing had happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but a sustainable cool@@ ness eman@@ ating from Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time had been kind@@ led .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen on Russia &apos;s back .
the off@@ ence was even bigger , as it was committed by an alleged friend .
building up the Vet@@ rop@@ ack will be difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look for@@ wards .
after all , this meeting was held only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been deprived of his office during a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Turkey has hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it respon@@ ds to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ it@@ tering palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an analy@@ st once described as an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that drive from the West and feel badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even taken the issue .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress it .
there is no clear consensus about where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State should at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland customers
according to the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange for Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we have no global goals but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ tual existence of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of brands , as how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bench for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3@@ .000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3@@ .000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ hen , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that this happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ ering when he wins the victory on pre @-@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ckey players reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have inspired fans for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already collected 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already suffered a winner almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British isolation for two decades .
it was annoying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s chief of staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s closest circle of trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Opport@@ unities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as the president of the Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Vice President since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the governing body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state on bills and controls to implement your statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ den@@ ces for a long time , working as he for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at present .
but the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , at once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , &quot; It is true that I have asked you for a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , for me this very complicated post - you could almost say - be trusted for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President &apos;s Office for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the state security service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of office , since a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close associate of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son on a release published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish landing in the garden in Ban@@ ff
in the identification of the fish , a citizen of Ban@@ ff called for help , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could be a sand wh@@ ale , which were sp@@ itted by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ity Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has over 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que cables .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic size in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a g@@ ong for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure represents tr@@ end@@ setting high and low construction .
after the installation of the last corner of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the expansion , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards at an ascent of about 3 % .
tri@@ cky , because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were tos@@ sed by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the incident at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and imagined the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we let water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and hanging at a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal ret@@ ord@@ ship and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the bo@@ ating engine had an emergency stop , the boat released the boat from the person who was ste@@ aling the boat .
someone has watched over these men this day .

who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors are supposed to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that in the coming years , Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 inexpensive apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept for living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe has been programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban surfaces , 20 percent of all apartments will have to feature in the future as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also be established in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , says Brat@@ st@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction funding program , which will cost millions and still need to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ st@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
not@@ withstanding that , so viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is taking place .
if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is still not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of some 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to the planner Nicole Palm , plans for planning should now be bought from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring flats back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , Fri@@ sten is running out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased again , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixture .
there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created out of it ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand over@@ loading the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person puts back every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch that followed 35@@ ,000 users , recently told the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of watched people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; get away from the sofa &quot; and &quot; being active each day &quot; ki@@ cked on de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also mur@@ der@@ ous gam@@ bl@@ ers who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will uni@@ fy apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast arrived on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es will play in the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday during the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected her a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the Spring , Texas family would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g after they won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the retired man @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top , this is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which included her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any more competition , a winning series that will last as long as she wishes .
even though Must@@ afa made light through two turns the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
floating beams and floor plans - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - was listening .
she recovered again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team cap , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her excav@@ ation she fell into the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , sometimes doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : three victims shot in a series of mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of mass kill@@ ings by Phoenix as they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was induced by the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two further injured in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found shells and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but just like the f@@ ew@@ est of his age , Ed@@ mund has a micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was that I couldn &apos;t do it .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself go for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress .
it can run and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has dre@@ amed of &quot; asking me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know it .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vessels , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while in the area of mobile it was still ra@@ ining .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in subur@@ ban areas near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a threat , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams sent people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his son @-@ son were among those saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water was streaming and pouring in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river during the 48 years she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he had res@@ cu@@ ed all three of them in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; floods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer announced in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was completely absorbed by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now both floo@@ ded .
the leader of the Rob@@ by Miller community said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by floo@@ ding .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags were provided for residents to take the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but no reported on Friday .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; sco@@ op@@ ed out of bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ving shooting in Philadelphia
the police announce that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was aware of his transportation to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was bul@@ ky with bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to be a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wn the scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di from the police station in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a sc@@ arf on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic community in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally mirrors the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female female female female female is a Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year was Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tik@@ routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but in this way gymn@@ as@@ tics are not visible throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport , and Tur@@ ner first and foremost in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued as required .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we must give the churches au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gym training .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics Foundation of 20 years .
in my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team that brings together thousands of young girls to get interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of Girl Power through the wood of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance physicians who voted for election rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t had un@@ veiled plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; no man &apos;s land , &quot; and any further delay for the staff and patients would be harmful .
the first investig@@ ators are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend fees to improve maintenance at irregular times .
Dr J Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance , shared last night in a communication with : &quot; Assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current issue of mat@@ ernity and to treat all physicians properly . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve the disputes caused by discussions were to take part in the government for ad@@ versity , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was due to a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now to lift up the condition and address the concerns of the resident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage for doctors on strike .
the ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to receive a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 investig@@ ators subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance physicians to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working combat measures achieve nothing that is little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing staff and their families only worries , distress and dis@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months we have talked to the investig@@ ator of the assistant doctors and answered positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries concerning the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a vocational training period , training dead@@ lines , reci@@ pro@@ cal recognition of cur@@ riculum , continuing education and the health ministry regarding compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ul@@ ating fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls causing plaque .
when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ aches the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the N@@ ICE draft , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness blo@@ oms up electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has caused widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities to be know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today exposed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally interfer@@ es with the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister for integration and local government , which is now a response king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead an ID card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , a vot@@ er has to mention his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they leave their votes in order to prevent someone to choose twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves electoral fraud , but is also meant to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and fiscal fraud which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s electoral sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly alert to the frau@@ dul@@ ent election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including fo@@ gging outs to prove identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric stated 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists work correspondence documents to stop &quot; picking up &quot; elections .
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud .
options consider asking voters to ask for your ID before choosing .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists process full mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes of post@@ ings .
the police have the authority to set up barriers to election stations .
a law amend@@ ment facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in election stations .
request that only English may be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees take the rule that voters go alone to the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that no criminal complaint was placed after the Tower Ham@@ lets case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - in accordance with the high standards of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court case in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country , as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t prolifer@@ ation of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
mad according to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by no means the only ath@@ lete struggling for gold that has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you can believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused an attack on Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking fellow , so I &apos;m argu@@ ing that as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; as low &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds comment@@ ator thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m open @-@ style pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who was caught up in the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , as low as a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ ov@@ i , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the flo@@ ats 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
audience throughout Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the tone and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emma &apos;s Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not realize that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ tah from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style flo@@ ater for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the union , baby . &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald &apos;s criticism on Twitter came quickly and hard , many of whom were talking to him .
Twitter users did not think back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ oo@@ elt .
shortly thereafter , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate phrase , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times to the people who responded to the blo@@ tice via Twitter
comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
last night , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was no cont@@ emp@@ t intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by women who tried sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
in order to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation she numbered , as she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back to the shelf .
she continued rum@@ bling and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , &quot; she rose again and left the store without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own string trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she lay them on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like her again and went out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants she had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to thinking that someone would take home under@@ pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got involved , the employees tried to pull clothes out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our Folk@@ stone branch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or the back , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the gun between your front arm and shoulder before h@@ itting it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist while the attack@@ er falls in front of pain , the weapon is out of his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and carrying the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Miz@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
traveler Ian W@@ right ch@@ ats his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and stran@@ gl@@ ehold of a serious test - putting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k finished his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ ear@@ ing button on a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking every object , he used a lumin@@ ance to show himself and us what he is going to get involved in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the idea of using the rinse button of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he tas@@ ked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task was definitely put under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after her L@@ umin@@ ometer number amounted to over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst I have rolled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey carried out by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they had terror@@ ised their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden boards were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ots , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cri@@ es , disputes and floods .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and the police had to be called on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing forced her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said that their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet - we weren &apos;t used to that !
now that they are gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family would have had to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the village hall
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see would agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a del@@ o@@ gation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gation on the floor .
workers in the house administration will have to swe@@ ep away waste mountains that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by got a fine , after it was found guilty of ow@@ ning a class B drug in commercial for@@ bear@@ ance .
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ by was killed in a car accident in 2013 .
after they have been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told us that the del@@ o@@ gation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without accus@@ ations , as well as those who were har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal stag@@ ger@@ ed after a martial military jet flew over the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force took an incredible flight
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no risk of security .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a pep@@ per@@ y jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew twice very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve just been surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the bad visibility of the area , the jet flew a little lower than usual due to the bad visibility , but the forces of the air insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people died in the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new soccer season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash increases three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ w@@ inner must refra@@ in from competing with the subordin@@ ate Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europe league champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who is riding the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also a lack of go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
in practice , the German suffered a change in construction in the knee , which at least initially clari@@ fied the demand for cash at Bar@@ ca in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
for two years , Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were competing for the status as number one .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen is the leader in most of the rest of the competition .
before the first obligatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team at the Spanish Master , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ me@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after prolon@@ gation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
Barcelona has eleven successes of the record winner in this competition so far .
Ma long in an own league to ping p@@ ong gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
in this way the World Ran@@ king @-@ first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would catch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and with time outs they had no coaches with themselves .
they had retired to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches until now for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ ons posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ versary only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang about 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma has not developed the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the German Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had suffered a ri@@ b injury , and after that he had to be treated with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have become Olympic @-@ Fourth in a similar high table tennis age .
Donald Tr@@ ump sums up &quot; enormous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire dealt with something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of Evangel@@ ical Christians who asked him for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt were false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by surv@@ ey@@ or in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were consistent with the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
in an interview by the radio station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how to stop the Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing else but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , he said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to strike funds to support his campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead of this , the Republi@@ cans candidates for the Congress may be stronger than the arms of the Congress .
Olympic : three @-@ dimensional fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to establish a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2004 Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told us that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported by the team management K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing control systems .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , the rehear@@ sal was handed over and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was in Beijing World Cup fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier , the team of Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya stands for a long time under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing events .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was previously noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
prior to the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on African countries to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there is to be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
l@@ ately , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this sport , it was possible to demonstrate that this sport became area @-@ wide and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; West Side Story &quot; Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical is captured in Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ verk@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth mare .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members Tony with melanch@@ oly , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is clever , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with it .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a joy@@ ous approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the off@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
it is the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as it was then .
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , reports re@@ port@@ edly in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
sul@@ tan was 17 years old and , after giving her family details , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ shaken land and to return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London entered a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS comb@@ at@@ ant in Syria and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay for the Supreme Court in case of election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democ@@ rat candidate H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the country &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ul@@ ating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and assistant heroes of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .

tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of old@@ school play@@ boys differs since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently it is the view that it does the calendar as well .
&quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish town@@ ship reck@@ ons with mass ev@@ asion
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh preparation of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass exo@@ dus to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand asylum seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already crossed Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pun@@ ish@@ ments already months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks are added .
many will want to start anew in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , which welcomes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of the Con@@ federation compl@@ ained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the expression pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President demanded that the government positioned itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ cians the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ ist , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports by calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum @-@ seek@@ ers recognized by political persecution in Germany already before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised as enti@@ tles ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no escape from war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum seek@@ ers under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 the Parliament elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for it is not stupid as it has been so far : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day elections - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count votes at the end , can only work hard .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern still has to pass the election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality .
S@@ ella , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as he did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , Seel@@ is@@ ers got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Angela is responsible for the thri@@ ving of the Af@@ D .
her refugee policy , her &quot; We create , &quot; ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which now probably costs him the beautiful ministry .
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaign at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to a large @-@ scale rally ; Angela Merkel &apos;s circle is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual poll@@ ing conditions at market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country you have to push away the base that it must be very hard to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are walking like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly anything in the w@@ edges of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his co @-@ workers is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is a lot of stake in the game , S@@ ella has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
the Socialists and Democrats recently poll@@ ed 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at election 2011 , the SPD had yet clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of vac@@ ations and embarrass@@ ed their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it calls the pres@@ idents Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green poll@@ s embar@@ k on search for traces of local vocal ch@@ ords among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
there are everywhere praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ends only at 8 : 00 p.m .
&quot; they did everything pretty well , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praise is also given to those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the installation of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site has been emig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg again exists , the traffic situation within the town is relaxed .
the citizens can now travel on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were sometimes considerable discomfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the management of the rehabilitation project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Sch@@ leich@@ wege searched for and were more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fr@@ ying .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality reinforced the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been lit .
the fastest speed was 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales arri@@ vals with them allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acquain@@ tance is of course lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals are most exploited along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
not only it , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was thrown back two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to let him go .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something has been handled more gener@@ ously .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other regular guests are now less frequent because of complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you can &apos;t drive here , it &apos;s also nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his family client@@ ele returns after the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is brutal .
it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws in the name of fighting terrorism .
following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick safety package .
but what has a status of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not over@@ burden anyone .
other additional points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was in charge of results and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for@@ mid@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has had enough time to pass before it presents its conclusions on security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , pointed out : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapon law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that had not yet been done with the SPD : he wants to set up sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers it reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
some of them have it in themselves : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aining people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of D@@ ul@@ ls for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or throw away their papers deliberately to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally tri@@ cky .
some of them still have an effect and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example - arises the question : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that were deeply occupied by the people could not be ignored in election campaign times .
the internal security has enormously moved into the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ tive campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , the two parties have passed high .
only a gar@@ gling dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security @-@ political ideas collection of some of the Ministers of the Interior , in which the resort chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also working here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a turning away from the double pass .
we met the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ make it , is not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally stable at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , has yet to show himself .
there is a lot of things in it , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals a cau@@ tious conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen gli@@ m@@ pf@@ ly through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
there are vor@@ tices about a term in the recall action .
in the event of deliveries , Volkswagen will continue to ste@@ er into the second half of the year .
despite the many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show an increase in the course of the course of the year .
but in July , the VW core brand weak@@ ens mainly in Western Europe and thus heavily poll@@ uted the sale as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
sales CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July , above all to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote poll@@ uted the exit from the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the USA , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the chi@@ ef@@ ly affected land@@ mark of the Lower Saxony is continuing to gli@@ m@@ ly through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is ech@@ o@@ ed .
group sales CEO Fred Kap@@ pler continued from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating exhaust tests with software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance are not deteri@@ or@@ ating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer had a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I am not talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as was stated on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reasons are legal refin@@ ements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for re@@ arm@@ oured diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this was confirmed by VW representatives at the German Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that this meeting was held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and of the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW assumed the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , after the conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will occur and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was meant in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , for half a year after the conversion , customers can come to a garage for half a year after the change@@ over - and that could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal is to prevent uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations , as it was called .
therefore , Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands p@@ uni@@ tive interest from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is subject to this fee as of September by private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 on bank or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been jumping for some time 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at my central bank account and costs 0,@@ 4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot pay 4000 euros for each million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now passed on according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
leaving the cash in the banks of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank board .
most customers would have understanding and change to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to carry it alone is &quot; economically not economically viable . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with a penalty of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay compensation for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is slightly more luxuri@@ ously furnished by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association is currently no further banks known to charge a replacement for inserts of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in their width .

according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gie .
those who have recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by amateur collectors - it has an emotional significance : older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and gra@@ zing wild@@ ly before I stop holding my hands and saying something better like this : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I von Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers he meets to meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I have led people have generally cleared up their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers to the record tag of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers took impulse to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects that call for happy singing memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that &apos;s so with me as a collector so and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a stack of boards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an IC@@ M survey in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have record players .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ ked through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : middle aged three ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just came here recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Vinyl sla@@ b so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ rich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who are only slowly entering .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the vinyl records , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts is the latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ ï@@ ve psych@@ ic trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
she is more of a window mannequ@@ in than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives away with a lovely si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I gave the impression of encouraging the pants @-@ hot pants , I watched a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; disk art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are un@@ considered , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not by st@@ rolling through the record stores on Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through panels , as they avoid the star@@ ving gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who rises over the shoulders of un@@ susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer for demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , in which thousands of refugees live .
in a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the court that the stores and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional stores and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely trac@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is self @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to uph@@ old the Kids Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors living in the jungle has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin stays milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ pro Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get down .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me it is hon@@ estly difficult to comment on the schedule of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World &apos;s World Championship in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll look at everything we &apos;ve changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time world champion , who on Wednesday had lost the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes to Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is a huge mess - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which special@@ ises in this hobby .
Microsoft didn &apos;t share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give up players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Spiel@@ eri@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ ups , which have been headquartered in Seattle in the US state , reloc@@ ate to Microsoft &apos;s headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced .
the acquisition will therefore not change anything for the customer .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
well @-@ known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was bought by online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google nut alphab@@ et .
here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to rely on the next generation speed sensor : new flashes are tested in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed limit@@ er for compliance with speed limits .
a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted using a modem .
laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as passage prohi@@ bitions according to time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also slip @-@ resistant outer she@@ ath disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and has now also been used .
also foreign authorities flashes with the new technology : recently France ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 copies last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class takes Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening in the final hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odoro stage in Rio .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back @-@ up , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but independently of this Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , former head of England of Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let the attacks boun@@ ce off from fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co. to run into running buses . the World Series winners went from 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au got over in the corner .
with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a gro@@ unding tor@@ ches of Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still about a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u ra@@ ged through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still taught .
that is the way it is .
GB performed basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , wave flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked down sm@@ ashed into the tur@@ f .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team guaranteed winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than in these games and that &apos;s what you mean .
from the first stroke to the last 220 hard p@@ ieve that go down into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ap@@ old in a second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports who laid on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9th un@@ shiel@@ ded insert , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ladies who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of Schwä@@ bisch Hall , which does not reflect the nature of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he .
behind each gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one was more helpful than the trainer who did not know before 30 months whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if the term in such circumstances is at all the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even greater one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning , spending a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked for .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for coaching or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning haven &apos;t lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something special .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary clarity provided for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water pur@@ se association as a model for large water producers .
some time ago , it was called the original sound in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia dig@@ ged up the purpose association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who worked for 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , 28 of them as Managing Director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ horn drinking water @-@ purpose association , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are parish churches , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for further towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , broad@@ brun@@ ner mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was employed as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , purchase of plots in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renov@@ ations of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and I have added innovations again and again , because water makes life easier and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has almost lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group on nit@@ rate reduction prior to the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , for his part , praised water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose association .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the rup@@ ture of the can@@ ister at the church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn only because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with tubes .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

meanwhile the police has published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rel@@ ational role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give information about the course of the day or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing delicate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from the green electricity production are from the table .
it remains with the exemp@@ tion from the renewable energy conversion in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases generated from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works are an EEG equivalent of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on the production of own electricity .
with this , the status quo of the current regulation is largely written .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be considered in the reform of emissions trading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers are propos@@ ing price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation is somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel have an effect ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have risen .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual pieces .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the steel Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced went back for the second month .
production has been at two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure since the beginning of the year .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with increasing output .
community , spirit , health : sing good sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she took the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and total livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular mer@@ ging , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
the elderly train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
if you regularly demand your lungs , you can &apos;t get out of the box quickly , even in everyday life .
even though it is about maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Association of senior citizens .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher significance , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often linked to positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
by lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia people de@@ compose themselves to long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires special power , L@@ enz explains .
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone are doing so , not only concentr@@ ating on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears there when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &quot; choir , you can simply join them .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many old women &apos;s choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet may ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet search .
those who like to sing should definitely join a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler advises .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than cat to cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the tail of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ cks also didn &apos;t let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of patho@@ gen of cat babies at the mi@@ ch@@ age of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up .
despite the low sample , the researchers keep their results meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , responded differently to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when the sound of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises in humans .
some studies also showed that women react more sensi@@ tively to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ bin is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ bin .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , another important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even at the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it will not stop there , even before football .
the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
accordingly , South @-@ America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r is to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency , which is initially imposed for 90 days , is still valid until October , in fact it has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ker &apos;s clubs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally don &apos;t count among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the majority of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially arriving to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as Top@@ scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also divide early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to gain something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract with AC Florence , had announced only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the storm would have to be ready to disp@@ ense with about one @-@ third of its estimated annual sal@@ aries , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay for Florence his salary . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic dop@@ ing continues to determine the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who su@@ ed after a Dop@@ ing @-@ Sper@@ r shortly before the games , was fl@@ attered and rested at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with an open smile , she was still standing in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when it was clear that it was not going to fetch gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ wick ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit six months in 2010 after taking the pain with Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ano@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement have been responsible , eu@@ ph@@ ased Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
so , T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing in it .
in 2004 , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title due to testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sport Tribunal of the Swiss Federal Court of Sports .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in rank 2 of the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record dancer and fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested positive in May , but can still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement , blocking the world &apos;s anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran off on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , spokes@@ man for foreign ministry , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already been able to leave this .
she planned her home tour for early September .
it is still unclear whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected by Austrian citizens .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a b@@ ypass .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
two jumps went up early on Friday morning , another human being killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ onation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive rate went into the air in front of the territorial police in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , even det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself as possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
the authorities in recent days have received intelligence evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they have not been informed about the exact time and places .
nor is it unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinfor@@ ce security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the well @-@ known bom@@ b@@ ings , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population will not be disman@@ tled in these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this has a major impact on the military in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , maintains itself to have the kingdom restored to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du cord - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity @-@ identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &apos; indications for efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Compl@@ aint Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ators in nine states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty bears &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as he said , his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
recently , there were reports of contacts from the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
as he said , he did not know what to do .
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party in question - in this case is the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
with a view of the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ined said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have established that there can be legally @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the open @-@ air group .
it may well be that other legally @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ets expressed concern about the fact that many sur@@ geri@@ es went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wor@@ rying thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the suspect attacks on asylum accommodation have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left who have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ wei@@ ghty s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
because most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the turn .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ min@@ ent election defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there &apos;s nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already had an alternative video .
he then asc@@ ends to the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US TV broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .
he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post increases into trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle for the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
soon the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
as of next year , the Post will also be offering its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and packages are delivered , even to other farms .
post @-@ management Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , e.g. by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in its post @-@ own production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and per shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles over the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K de@@ parts its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the returns suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ad@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the global number five of the industry faces a new beginning .
the executive director of the GF@@ RP will leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , will reti@@ re from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , retired by the Management Board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on 1 September , informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to focus on long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who will be leading the market research company in future is still unclear at this time .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were at least dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder would some@@ day become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would do the odds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company failed to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable figure in the previous year .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent to € 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was primarily imp@@ acted by the lower value of the company .
the company value ratings of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , resulted in a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K achieved a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) eight people were injured in the accident of a travel bus with 43 sen@@ iors .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , informed the police .
according to her specification , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to diver@@ t her data to an opposite truck , which was partly on the tra@@ m@@ way .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency medical ambul@@ ance came to the accident location on the state road 2 .
the most recent travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators urged the trucks and potential witnesses to report to the police .
from October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will amount to € 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros for the area of the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the budget was approved by the Office of the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that sub@@ coverings for these sewage systems were opened .
due to legal grounds , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to resort deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a new calculation of fees for sewage installations of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , transitions from the previous calculation period will also be equ@@ ated .
the serious fee increases prompted Schmidt to manage relatively small installations with a very low waste water fall , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to the age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair costs , the renovation and repair costs of all three plants will continue to be considerable .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the se@@ wer system Az@@ endorf due to a damage .
the pumping station Wel@@ z@@ ahl had to be over@@ hau@@ led by nearly 20 years old conveyor systems and , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be dischar@@ ged , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility was installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water plant in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance are &quot; fully hat@@ ched . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt added , the market community has been spar@@ ed from major maintenance costs for sewage installations over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal wastewater purpose association cannot be expanded by these facilities because they are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % posted .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a rise in prices of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine evaluations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on critic@@ ised
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , it allows to chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ flo@@ wer@@ ed , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ understand@@ ings arrive at the public .
in the past , snap@@ shots have been critic@@ ised in which they were bl@@ amed that the app would promote black face promotions or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when it proposed a filter to some users this week , which gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was conceived as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as a carto@@ on by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the an@@ alogy comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photographs , was that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and gentle , &quot; said Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contra@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ y , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the decreasing extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older counter@@ players - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , working as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
she said in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview that she believes ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of snap@@ shots .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white male leadership , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left the Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel manager focusing on sub@@ represented populations and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , in turn , said that she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &apos; .
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes committee of Congress
military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on @-@ site , an investigation committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the force tek@@ om@@ mit@@ es , intelligence committees and military budget com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how superi@@ ors put their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically em@@ itted by high @-@ level Cent@@ com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ urs , regularly subscri@@ bed to a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on @-@ site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , a republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , noted .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the US efforts in training the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts con@@ forming to the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com affiliate announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to live after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Defense Secretary &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor .
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com group created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ ats in the Com@@ mitt@@ ee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were received after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor were still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall the dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time insist@@ ed on making thoughts of the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this finding was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
USA wins fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , show@@ down with the UK
one day after having shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two doors for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember this ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
that knows them though : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of them will win the first and second place within their group of six teams each .
the first place will go out of the way for the strong Dutch somewhat longer , which will lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have spark@@ ed a surprising host through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , started to turn things into a better one .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been able to ri@@ pen the ru@@ dder completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the tor@@ r@@ als in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India had gone into the game without winning the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and pl@@ ung@@ ed the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book one goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the tri@@ ath@@ lete to become a tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s chat in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could certainly have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV ads , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold at the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , some in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I should have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se noticed the last 16 years that many of those I had surv@@ eyed did not know that it is an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 had been an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .

the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ educated ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ otic tre@@ mor of his never ending ben@@ evol@@ ent impact - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ ol@@ on , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , ho@@ ckey and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to official Olympic program according to design , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 male and 16 female athletes compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go ahead in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the goal , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also another highlight in the television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ que record .
the targeted aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir one spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel ti@@ ring even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
amid the Olympia @-@ man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the ang@@ gling and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts recently proposed - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to get into the air .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators who call for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia straight to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ attered the country and spread to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was mer@@ cil@@ ess .
witnesses stated that police officers shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to combat terrorism beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organizations have continually led the government &apos;s oppression - the country &apos;s opposition to the country has been cur@@ tail@@ ed , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options but to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tes@@ home , a tut@@ or in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the governing coalition .
after a far critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border reach Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ g@@ aden have been forced to use the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves once more in recent years .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of h@@ ink@@ ly under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate over Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they gathered in such protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ ks and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ ks and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ae@@ dic@@ s predominantly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ ks , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but that too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population , dominant in the military , secret services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North @-@ Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not trust the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to statements of analysts apparently were ple@@ dged by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
Ethiop@@ ian development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation .
but apparently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ osi@@ tions of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en flights over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin cord hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump sums up his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who try to protect him during an event@@ ful period of protection , into the peculiar position of having to explain statements which he could not have meant at all .
after making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump retired in relation to the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radio pres@@ enter Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he was trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling uph@@ eav@@ als .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then to row back as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the vote for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone because his survey values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading edge in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ okes have brought his loyal co @-@ workers to the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent advoc@@ ates , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements asked if Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ben@@ ders , completely wrong and that is why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by subj@@ ecting the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive .
before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of dealing with each of his words and pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once crowded at the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
ver@@ b Cafe was a cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which wasn &apos;t Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , bought in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local residents smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a city of gent@@ ri@@ fication .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , it is also a rein@@ vention .
a revi@@ ved club opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing co @-@ worker of the old café , owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do so , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a great deal .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , used to live in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee t@@ ines for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realised that it was about coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will respond to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tends to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the floor when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fancy for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ c@@ tional snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the ways with which the country was about not to be the land of Cock@@ aig@@ ne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; tile man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the focus of American cuisine for years , became a seldom served luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome cuisine .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tile mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists , including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , drove the eating habits of the country like that .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and to meet the challenge of transforming P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the millions @-@ millions @-@ man of the world to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to take an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mr@@ s Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country reg@@ ained its feet .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the case of wind blowing .
after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to give a nice name to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone re@@ appeared somewhat rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly in the t@@ ines , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took a stop three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil defence group that , according to the image paper , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to attract people from bom@@ bed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the painting c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sh@@ arks only get up to 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats lei@@ surely at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long suspected that Greenland will be stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their time @-@ pent@@ pent@@ o measured them , when they buried six animals with one transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , who swing from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , the fis@@ her between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long while the largest was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers in size .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are not renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks stri@@ k@@ ingly had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons tried to produce large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small amount of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear tests , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , which originates from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai females only get offspring when they are more than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to classi@@ fy the length of an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the reproduction obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
also this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on fl@@ ames .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
the municipal council focuses on topics relating to building construction in the most recent session .
with relief , the Board accepted the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and access questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications were made for surve@@ ying , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Extension section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way .
the community council is convinced that the blo@@ kes in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and the elderly alike .
as it was said , building licenses can immediately report in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to be able to demand en@@ quiries about the establishment of further commercial operations connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already shown there is expanded by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies reloc@@ ated from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt most benefit from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets Financial Markets and the Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether banks should continue to operate from London through financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , approval in the UK is enough for the so @-@ called EU passport .
that is what big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is meeting the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg ad@@ mitt@@ edly covers a large fund sector , but also cuts off the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the city boasts easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate were 50 percent higher than on the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the consultants Merc@@ er , the city stood at No. 7 , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin in No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial center for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract additional banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researcher .
the correlation of forces is also important : according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead wins legal expenses from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ cal C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after an American judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including his per@@ jur@@ ation and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US Secretary @-@ General , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ance on costs arising during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck used mutually compl@@ ained and acquired property on laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir was founded , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the US have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters buried within the city .
they liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan shared Dar@@ wish the Man@@ bi@@ j milit@@ ant of Reu@@ ters , allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting clean@@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal tax
H@@ illary Clinton published its 2015 tax return on Friday , which resulted in USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the Democ@@ rat candidate and her husband .
in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech hon@@ ors ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her mandate in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the past ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ pul@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations although they are not oblig@@ ated by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the release of the Democratic candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections were not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organisations , its business units and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump encourages his tax return .
on Thursday she also talked about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump did not pay or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals paying more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to an I@@ RS tax audit and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons Camp@@ aig@@ n has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of around 40@@ ,5 % .
the 2015 tax returns showed that they were only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their major money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , Fire@@ works bodies promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into settlements inhabited by humans - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ te .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion together with U.S. natural protection by exercising volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Day Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell said in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ work body , whose end is turned to the ignition line .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ci@@ li@@ pu@@ te into the air .
a hint is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
one last opportunity is a thro@@ wer shooting a fire@@ work fire@@ works in the air and causing a loud , light explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no new ki@@ osk at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects take place from commercial operators with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - the retail trade in the core city is regarded as significantly out@@ stand@@ able .
however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sales ski depot on the Rhine shore in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony located in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally we welcome new businesses , but this ki@@ osk does not fit in an exposed location on the shore of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election has been removed after an Arab call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre @-@ election because Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee .
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary , &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the New Germany , to eliminate and er@@ ase Israel ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a way to choose Israel from its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ blatt named this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yiel@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a different contribution , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not take Israel into the express list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added that the country code has been added .
police deplo@@ y tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police using rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ est@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since international sanctions have been lifted up against Iran , the interest shown on the side of Russian companies in businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies embar@@ k on existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent over the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian delegation represented around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid on Thursday evening was carried out on the Re@@ we XXL beverage market at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the hold of a fire@@ arm three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the issu@@ ance of cash by the staff of the drink market and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been exploited , the police do not share .
the perpet@@ rators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the Park@@ deck of the Re@@ we market .
the cul@@ pr@@ its must be known after the attack in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and , from the gravel parking lot located opposite the parking entrance , will have fled with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ egi@@ vers during their summer leisure in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet seclu@@ ded area of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the string zoo .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world famous monastery .
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
during the hot days , the group took pleasure in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing .
culinary delights include children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared food such as the Sau@@ ren Spa@@ etz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ kt , beautiful jewels made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ ting @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage of all the young stran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ ten@@ Round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
several pilgrimage goals have been tested and they finally decided for the bishop city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on the cathedral of Freiburg .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ chambers were on the way .
in the evening earlier , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and informed the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Mu@@ enster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started .
the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made a rest to sing together a song made of specially made pilgri@@ m song .
the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage targets Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast .
it continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous stretch of road , but at the low heat some 500 metres altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is made visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy in the late afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gate of mercy .
God thank@@ ed God with a small impulse .
the Min@@ is of co@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , who arrived at the evening mass in Münster , were welcomed .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the l@@ ati@@ tudes metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rest@@ ated the final evening in the men &apos;s team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that was made by his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the boy was proud when he stor@@ med home to bring home a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ah@@ old med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the railway world champi@@ onships in London , despite the Ho@@ ys &quot; withdrawal .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now developed .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner put an Olympic cord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y got the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they got on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic circuit in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hin@@ du : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the Tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in cycling .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y , who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a prey of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be defeated as a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , with W@@ ig@@ gins focusing on safety .
yesterday he had been argu@@ ing with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Des@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 0@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong team of trains to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , as the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton , technical director in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
future of melt production from Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of energy demand
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places for workers - are at stake , as the plant operator canc@@ els the energy supply contract and thereby canc@@ els all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to forgive any further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2,000 work@@ places in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melt consumption consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the point Henry Schmel@@ zi@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ding with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would have entered into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential effects on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual statement of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to issue the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the melt , &quot; did not interfere .
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market this would mean a considerable reduction in the demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a das@@ h of reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
San Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
the trade mark Ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and running at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , descri@@ p@@ tive reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problem cases and the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classical twist : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d action of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on girl at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with a view to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of existence has begun with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold out of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference similar to a picture book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to the 8@@ 32 pages of the walt@@ z 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still filtered before official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; break @-@ through model &quot; of their generation - falls under the former category , is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or youth of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything is true for J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been a bit ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the bu@@ ggers of the moment . &quot;
these feelings ech@@ o@@ ed again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to ride around on the mis@@ si@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
San Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for her pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is on Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community Centr@@ es annually show 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s emergency hot@@ lines are held annually by the community centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further short cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are prepared for further reductions .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of its federal funding .
the director of the Municip@@ alities of Fri@@ esland James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that without repe@@ ating the resolution of the Federal Government , the situation would only get worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Community Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released through divisions , workers who have been released un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their clients &quot; communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indic@@ ted after employee allegedly drew gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after inform@@ ing that her campaign manager for North Carolina had a gun on a staff while they were on the way in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knee bra@@ ce , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced in his indictment .
after compl@@ aining with local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four other persons had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sh@@ uss@@ el Ow@@ ners and We@@ ap@@ ons - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not be offen@@ ded by violence .
ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence and Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to achieve this opinion .
attempts to contact Philip were just as wrong .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
he did not respond to calls from his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of countries &apos; elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U are distinguished .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ c@@ ely rule in the north , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite mild losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament at 3 per cent each .
according to the survey , the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only reached 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they thus still lag behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives at 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator appeared on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not well in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty pal@@ p@@ able .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would today suff@@ ice for roughly two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to stores exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the era of the smartphone era .
since then everything has been different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone line of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market domin@@ ates suppliers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , which is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion units were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has been created around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all easily accessible via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look at it .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average each German today looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff at the Siemens board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure all our nations and regions benef@@ itted from playing .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities alone , we have already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , who will create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of extending He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ aged on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked to him .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in natural growth and to bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and to the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most popular cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking are equal to a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ings on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ promote advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with the fact that his desktop page would change coding regarding his advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the all@@ uring open source community and the b@@ ans has already been in progress since the invention of displays &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ on@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ wers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook .
the company has set it on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker with .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with the fact that it would update its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to control people more control over them .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that ad@@ mins would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we &apos;re planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
to over@@ ride a woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was over@@ powered by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that at the age of 49 a Swiss woman , who was driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who invites them , as well as every witness of the incident , to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes divided Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hof@@ st@@ etter said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the car@@ eless kill@@ ings after crossing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , who had responded to an emergency call , set up a justi@@ fiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have previously identified her@@ d@@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
on Thursday Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ned as trainer and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led a low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic@@ confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said Roy in an opinion .
during the summer I have been thinking a long time about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , which it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations needs to be perfectly coordinated with the organization .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ acc@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ en and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles on wages for North Sea workers are suspended , while all conflic@@ ting parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few day @-@ to @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a@@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the Star Cluster as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star @-@ mount , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now turning the fastest .
to peak @-@ rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars clas@@ h large amounts of star @-@ win@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very light stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base zu Base .
following his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will take the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to you , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez has paid off for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he has created the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not supposed to be included in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted that ster@@ oids were banned between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet@@ ff@@ is@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days do not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and re@@ affir@@ med the relationships with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ als Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : little X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a learned ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ champion Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news come to an end .
last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was detected in Ch@@ en , which is used as a mass@@ aging agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon local time , the International Criminal Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butterfly , only 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have taken part in the course of more than 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S in charge of sanc@@ tioning athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news le@@ aked on the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the forbidden substance is to act on the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already had a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov promptly spoke to the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z .
both deny taking , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , but also the nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China also caused fierce disputes among athletes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 metres of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positively on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 with the Chinese nationals , but only had to sit a three month lock .
dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; developers of black@@ mailing malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes amongst 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to corporate jackets occurred rapidly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the end key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production still stands .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the affected German firms reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business activity , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand for perpet@@ rators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and came to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to gain more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are redeemed after payment of a few hundred dollars , companies must sometimes negotiate hard and pay 5 @-@ digit sums in order to receive their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware @-@ Kits were created by purchasing the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ers are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per certified machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually criminals associate sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware has become known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful capture , the perpet@@ rators thre@@ aten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators could also gain completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the de@@ con chi@@ pper conference , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling away .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a boot space of 4@@ 53 l on high @-@ rise and 10@@ 26 l for inver@@ ted back@@ rests available , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1,@@ 24 metres high from floor to ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel tested with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work slightly qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the city emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane support assistant .
the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the high beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles speed when needed .
however , full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline not liable : fall on a passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible in case of dangers that are typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline did not have to pay any damages to the man .
case report : when pays the organizer
people who are ill will only get money after their trip if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family had suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ ni@@ b vacation .
she spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective sewage treatment plant , which was allegedly poll@@ uted by sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
the treatment plant indeed was defective .
but the Organ@@ izer knew only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information so the judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 guests of 6@@ 91 guests .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must act prud@@ ently and decisi@@ vely at the same time react to terrorist threats .
of course , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to terrorists .
if off@@ ences would have to leave the country more quickly , however , security and strength are also given the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a tran@@ sposition of proposals to the 2017 Bundestag election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years in the middle four @-@ digit order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , the right of weapons to be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult .
the last long @-@ deb@@ ated duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be kept in accordance with De Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the danger of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ ness ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the discern@@ ing makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ban ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality earlier .
he considers that a general ban on full @-@ veil is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject wearing the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating action and action with new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the highway feeder
it st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the right @-@ wing @-@ deviation should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when driving through the auto@@ bahn ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ er Straße exit , the right @-@ hand lane by 700 metres .
drivers can then enter directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic spl@@ its up early , which improves the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Min@@ ster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ t@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
this is the reason why the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 is shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only lane @-@ lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ assembled some years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load @-@ carrying capacity in order to include two @-@ lane in particular heavy load traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ day traffic jam will last will not be able to say the local operation .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the state of the country has deliberately chosen traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays , because it is expected to be able to count on disability .
traffic will be continued on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House attended an introduction to the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
most of the young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are being planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star@@ ving bu@@ ff Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep far ahead of the alarm rang .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , such problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and over ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as non @-@ restor@@ ative .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disturbances , and many causes can be based on them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , a member of the board of the German Society for Batt@@ les and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you understand , however , is in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ fusion and in@@ som@@ nia .
just sleeping feels many people as un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently is sleep distur@@ b@@ ance expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common for depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to talk about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with your doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - question .
there is hardly any lowered sleeping physician in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , she advises .
this can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for example , for examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise doctors in snor@@ ing with respiratory drop@@ outs , in case of in@@ patient wear@@ iness , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at the normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a probe at the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping end on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can apply for a better sleep .
wo@@ es count on : regular sleeping and up@@ time , do not sleep too long , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German swimming pool Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he obtained gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a short @-@ track world champi@@ onships and at the same time set up his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his ex @-@ team @-@ mates standing in the cri@@ tique .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries which promote a great deal and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS of independent control systems of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; demands the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop .
airport : Ban@@ de held by Bag@@ gage
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , the prosecution of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 was successful in the police of Düsseldorf &apos;s police .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags of bags and baggage as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognized a band that was known to the police from past theft offen@@ ders .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes this year since mid @-@ July and were especially passionate , work @-@ provo@@ king and especially professional .
the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ ent Commission 34 can prove four acts to the eves , who had been specifically invited to commit crimes to Germany .
they had taken over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , a few Lin@@ den@@ bä@@ um@@ chen , in between still a remnant cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ing : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain doesn &apos;t seem like that , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when you walk along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ ch@@ eted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , is already built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be preferred in the last few weeks , however , preferably with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially Berlin &apos;s internal sen@@ ator Henkel has been advoc@@ ating for a strong action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were cleared with 300 police officers , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three team @-@ cars on site , un@@ locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers pulled off the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who runs three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open up between the occup@@ ants and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which , even today compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ators from all over the world in recent years : residents from East @-@ GDR times and former home owners are now sharing their neighbourhood with them .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on dis@@ car@@ ded discs or freshly painted facades , which were raised with colour bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the criminal off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , who were not sure .
even the famous fuel @-@ burning cars no longer exist in the Riga .
for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been consciously drawn into the Riga Street - and remained .
that is why it was so important to her that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , who all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former building blocks that crowd the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums which are not interesting for many of them - here people who are not so well @-@ contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who goes into a pub district , can complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups for refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the dis@@ car@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than for the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to write the passage .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an aff@@ or@@ ding Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it concerns organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports genuine and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find flats for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accom@@ o@@ date the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these properties have to be borne by the local authorities themselves .
responsibility changes from the Land Department to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it has not func@@ tioned so far , so it is necessary to rely on private dwell@@ ings , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is said to be so beautiful .
thus , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine reported .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to positive external action .
that is &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot;
but work doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers like sports , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and honorary officials jump .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
if somebody at some point develop the feeling he can &apos;t help anybody in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems , says the customer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : have the two fears of radic@@ alization after the recent events , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer says quite clearly , &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve might call . &quot; a residual risk can and may not exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins will completely re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so Haupt@@ - and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they are always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
this question is clearly to be answered , the politics ab@@ h@@ or .
it is actually unfair to put them on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach yet , where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher has already been utilized to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : burg@@ lar@@ s with helicop@@ ters wanted
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
on Friday morning two unknown men have forci@@ bly entered an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .

the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 feet tall , well mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled towards the city centre .
at the end of the investigation , the police deployed several nu@@ ances as well as a police helicopter .
the findings were without success .

Thur@@ in@@ gia : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec came closer to sales @-@ billion
a high demand for medical technology in Asia has stimulated the sales of Carl Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec .
in the first nine months of the financial year started in October , Group sales rose by 6.@@ 7 percent to 79@@ 8.@@ 6 million euros , as the listed company announced on Friday in Jena .
the Asian business grew dispro@@ portion@@ ately by 17.@@ 1 percent .
according to the interim balance , earnings before interest and taxes increased from EUR 8@@ 9.5 million to EUR 110@@ ,5 million .
in this financial year , the Jena Medical Technology Group plans to exceed the sales figure of one billion euros , the Executive Board reiter@@ ated .
Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec produces equipment and equipment for medical practices and clinics .
the company , which belongs to the optics and electronics company Carl Zei@@ ss ( Ober@@ kochen ) , employs nearly 3000 people .
