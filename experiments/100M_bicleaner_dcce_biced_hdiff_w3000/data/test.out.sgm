<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they drove home to the forage in a fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at that pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding carer then ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swear for photo-purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, silver bay leaf, champions tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already rebuked him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidential candidates are not at all in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump does not want to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to drive the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will greatly reduce regulations, and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and therefore needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "we must invest in that," "" "says Trump and Clinton almost verbatim." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical party of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, party-internal discussions could come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more apparent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump intends to build coal-fired power plants and reboot coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in areas protected so far, it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "with its investment programme Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both are not willing to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7,25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to get up, then he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the large discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are suggesting him that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowls.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few devotees for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs opened the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>

<seg id="30">Those who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, err, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and at worst abused.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy assistants have called upon their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes with respect to a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed fluffy and it hardly radiated heat, even for its restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report, five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable coolness emanating from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time had been kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen on Russia's back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger, as it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the Vetropack will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forwards.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been deprived of his office during a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Turkey has hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it responds to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued resentment on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an analyst once described as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that drive from the West and feel badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played its role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they hadn't even taken the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered the release of Ivanovo from his duties as the president of the Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Vice President since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he later became the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the governing body.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on bills and controls to implement your statements." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidences for a long time, working as he for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president, at once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, "It is true that I have asked you for a conversation at the beginning of 2012, for me this very complicated post - you could almost say - be trusted for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President's Office for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the state security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of Queensland crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four sealings of the" "" "ceiling blower" "" "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has over 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic size in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a gong for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents trendsetting high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last corner of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards at an ascent of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tricky, because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fortunately, everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens said:" "" "investors are supposed to be much stronger in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "action concept for living" "" "at the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife has been programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD group leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban surfaces, 20 percent of all apartments will have to feature in the future as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also be established in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big issue in the town hall is, says Bratstmann:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban residential construction funding program, which will cost millions and still need to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, says Bratstmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding that, so viola, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is taking place.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how to compensate for the loss of some 1,300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the planner Nicole Palm, plans for planning should now be bought from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring flats back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, Fristen is running out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, it is removed from the goal of so-called mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "said Group president Holger Herlitschke:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and finally limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990ies (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created out of it).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand overloading the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person puts back every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that followed 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of watched people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "get away from the sofa" and "being active each day" kicked on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also murderous gamblers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unify apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast arrived on Thursday for a multi-campaign title and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles will play in the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday during the single multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected her a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the Spring, Texas family would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after they won gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired man-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which included her typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gym, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any more competition, a winning series that will last as long as she wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa made light through two turns the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and floor plans - in which Biles holds the world title - was listening.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15.433 on the floating beam and sat on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her grandchild - a pure form of formality - and tears poured on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team cap, which is called" "" "Oma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her excavation she fell into the audience of Kusshes, overwhelmed by a comeback, sometimes doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="10">Investigators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's olympic community in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female female female female female is a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year was Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but in this way gymnastics are not visible throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like gymnastics are an expensive sport, and Turner first and foremost in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as required.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must give the churches aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics Foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that brings together thousands of young girls to get interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of Girl Power through the wood of the Olympic team golds and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed agreement with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistance physicians who voted for election rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "no man's land," and any further delay for the staff and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first investigators are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend fees to improve maintenance at irregular times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr J Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Assistance, shared last night in a communication with: "Assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current issue of maternity and to treat all physicians properly."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes caused by discussions were to take part in the government for adversity, and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was due to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt has to act now to lift up the condition and address the concerns of the resident." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Should he not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a replenishment of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage for doctors on strike.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed agreement with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like to receive a better weekend pay for the 54,000 investigators subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of NHS employees, urged the assistance physicians to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "working combat measures achieve nothing that is little, but strain already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, nursing staff and their families only worries, distress and disruption." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months we have talked to the investigator of the assistant doctors and answered positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries concerning the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a vocational training period, training deadlines, reciprocal recognition of curriculum, continuing education and the health ministry regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulating fatty material in the artery walls causing plaque.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE draft, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness blooms up electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has caused widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities to be knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today exposed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally interferes with the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister for integration and local government, which is now a response king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should lead an ID card to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, a voter has to mention his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink on a person's finger if they leave their votes in order to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this not only serves electoral fraud, but is also meant to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and fiscal fraud which is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's electoral scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court decided that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly alert to the fraudulent election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including fogging outs to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it is said:" "" "as evidence it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there were concerns that... governmental institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour because of" "" "politically correct" "" "hypersensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric stated 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists work correspondence documents to stop "picking up" elections.</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Options consider asking voters to ask for your ID before choosing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists process full mailings and envelopes of postings.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up barriers to election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A law amendment facilitated by an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act (1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of photographing in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Request that only English may be used in the elective stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees take the rule that voters go alone to the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal complaint was placed after the Tower Hamlets case.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - in accordance with the high standards of criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "he also criticises the ineffective" "" "check-ups" "" "of the election registration departments of the town hall." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court case in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country, as the Mother of Parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert proliferation of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to flip the skewer for your predator.</seg>

<seg id="7">Then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist while the attacker falls in front of pain, the weapon is out of his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright chats his tongue to the dirtiest places of Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and stranglehold of a serious test - putting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk finished his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a dishearing button on a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking every object, he used a luminance to show himself and us what he is going to get involved in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of using the rinse button of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he tasked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to sinks of toilets, the task was definitely put under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after her Luminometer number amounted to over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst I have rolled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstormings that ended up saying" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because they had terrorised their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelby and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden boards were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseballots, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and the police had to be called on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said that their life was made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They were not afraid of anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have had to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the village hall</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the lessee would agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have boldly approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will have to sweep away waste mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="18">Prior to the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a great deal of pressure on African countries to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in 2021 the Parliament elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">For it is not stupid as it has been so far: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes at the end, can only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern still has to pass the election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sella, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as he did his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelisers got cold feet and chancellor Angela is responsible for the thriving of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "We create," hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which now probably costs him the beautiful ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaign at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to a large-scale rally; Angela Merkel's circle is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely eliminates the usual polling conditions at market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, says Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noticed that in the country you have to push away the base that it must be very hard to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are walking like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly anything in the wedges of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his co-workers is also self-exposing:" "" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Goldene weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot of stake in the game, Sella has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Socialists and Democrats recently polled 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At election 2011, the SPD had yet clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the necessity of vacations and embarrassed their election campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online campaign," "" "it calls the presidents Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green polls embark on search for traces of local vocal chords among the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are everywhere praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 8: 00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty well," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "praise is also given to those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to the installation of makeshift trips." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been emigrated to the south on Monday and the blockage of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the town is relaxed.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were sometimes considerable discomfort," "" "says Florian King, responsible for the management of the rehabilitation project." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichwege searched for and were more familiar with their Navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were frying.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality reinforced the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales arrivals with them allows everyone to look through.</seg>

<seg id="29">Not only it, but all the restaurants have hit it hard. "</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>

<seg id="41">If you can't drive here, it's also nice somewhere else.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "this will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "said the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still considers it reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>

<seg id="22">In the case of Dulls for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or throw away their papers deliberately to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally tricky.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still have an effect and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example - arises the question: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it does not run smoothly in all markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are vortices about a term in the recall action.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the event of deliveries, Volkswagen will continue to steer into the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the many brands and a number of well-running markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to show an increase in the course of the course of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the VW core brand weakens mainly in Western Europe and thus heavily polluted the sale as the company listed in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year's month with 449100 cars worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries dropped by almost one sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sales CEO Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July, above all to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, there has been a purchase restraint in some core markets through "changed economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote polluted the exit from the EU, a spokeswoman explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust gases first escalated, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the chiefly affected landmark of the Lower Saxony is continuing to glimly through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is echoed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales CEO Fred Kappler continued from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulating exhaust tests with software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the conversion, Volkswagen reaffirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of the vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance are not deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "after the conversion, the car manufacturer had a" "" "warranty" "" "certificate, but I am not talking about a" "" "guarantee" "" "as was stated on Friday in company circles." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Reasons are legal refinements.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Focus" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for rearmoured diesel models." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Last Monday, this was confirmed by VW representatives at the German Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that this meeting was held.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and of the KBA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "deviations from this are not accepted," "" "declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW assumed the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance, after the conversion, no deteriorations will occur and all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "Volkswagen itself does not use the term" "" "guarantee" "" "but not as it was meant in corporate travel." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, for half a year after the conversion, customers can come to a garage for half a year after the changeover - and that could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In customer interest, it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal is to prevent uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, Volkswagen does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before attempting to comment, under the pseudonym non-Allegrenmen's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed reemergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-Nostalgie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and grazing wildly before I stop holding my hands and saying something better like this: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I von Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, middle aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets to meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led people have generally cleared up their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of trailers to the record tag of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers took impulse to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that call for happy singing memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's so with me as a collector so and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flees from a stack of boards." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I smoked through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: middle aged three) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Vinyl slab so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-rich.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who are only slowly entering.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the vinyl records, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sexed pop instead of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but naïve psychic trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more of a window mannequin than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drives away with a lovely sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I gave the impression of encouraging the pants-hot pants, I watched a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "disk art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, they are unconsidered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not by strolling through the record stores on Berwick Street and the sheets through panels, as they avoid the starving gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the Calais jungle, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, sell barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the stores and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional stores and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely traceable. "</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is self-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the Kids Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to rely on the next generation speed sensor: new flashes are tested in various federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed limiter for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation; the case data is transmitted encrypted using a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as passage prohibitions according to time, driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the highly experienced state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening in the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-up, line-up and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England of Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let the attacks bounce off from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell an and Co. to run into running buses. the World Series winners went from 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau got over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A grounding torches of Mitchell halted the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athjasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still about a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou raged through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still taught.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB performed basic changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Seeinsulans, whose fans sang, wave flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff rang, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked down smashed into the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team guaranteed winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than in these games and that's what you mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last 220 hard pieve that go down into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiapold in a second without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports who laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unshielded insert, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant ladies who glide across the surface with the elegance of Schwäbisch Hall, which does not reflect the nature of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference, and no one was more helpful than the trainer who did not know before 30 months whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if the term in such circumstances is at all the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even greater one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-raising morning, spending a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked for.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you to him. he's the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for coaching or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen called" "" "stay in the process, stay in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something special.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the kennel association, 28 of them as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Veitensteinhorn drinking water-purpose association, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are parish churches, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for further towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, broadbrunner mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was employed as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), purchase of plots in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the renovation of the elevated tank (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renovations of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no standstill and I have added innovations again and again, because water makes life easier and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has almost lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group on nitrate reduction prior to the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water wart Alfons Griebel who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from the green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the exemption from the renewable energy conversion in the existing systems for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Western German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases generated from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works are an EEG equivalent of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on the production of own electricity.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered under overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened further, when the world's largest producer of China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are proposing price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation is somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have an effect; on the other hand, economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual pieces.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the steel Wirtschaftsvereinigung announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the quantity produced went back for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Production has been at two percent lower than the previous year's figure since the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with increasing output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: sing good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she took the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a Senior Citizens Choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and total livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular merging, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">The elderly train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you regularly demand your lungs, you can't get out of the box quickly, even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it is about maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Employment Association of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher significance, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often linked to positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia people decompose themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires special power, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone are doing so, not only concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors "choir, you can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many old women's choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet may ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who like to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>

<seg id="24">Nor is it unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>

<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic Games or World Records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the easily overweighty swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently transformed into a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his course with a setback of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old participating in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>

<seg id="1">From October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will amount to €3.44 instead of 2,10 euros for the area of the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (previously 2,18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Office of the District Office Kulmbach, it was established that subcoverings for these sewage systems were opened.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal grounds, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016 citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to resort deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of fees for sewage installations of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, transitions from the previous calculation period will also be equated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious fee increases prompted Schmidt to manage relatively small installations with a very low waste water fall, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to the age of refurbishment and repair costs, the renovation and repair costs of all three plants will continue to be considerable.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewer system Azendorf due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pumping station Welzahl had to be overhauled by nearly 20 years old conveyor systems and, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be discharged, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility was installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "to these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came to an end." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water plant in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance are "fully hatched."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared from major maintenance costs for sewage installations over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater purpose association cannot be expanded by these facilities because they are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, it allows to chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-flowered, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misunderstandings arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, snapshots have been criticised in which they were blamed that the app would promote black face promotions or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when it proposed a filter to some users this week, which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it racist caricature of Asians -" "" "yellow face." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it had deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was conceived as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the analogy comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread over the photographs, was that the filter was "hurtful and gentle," said Grace Sparapani. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contrasting Asian caricature and filter effect." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowy, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the decreasing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older counterplayers - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, working as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">She said in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview that she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of snapshots.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white male leadership, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left the Snapchat largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a personnel manager focusing on subrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, in turn, said that she will be closed to her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K. '.</seg>

<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the US efforts in training the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts conforming to the facts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom affiliate announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Defense Secretary's General Inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom group created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "said the highest-ranking democrats in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged the morals under analysts and" "" "gave a little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, who were received after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the general inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall the disagreements of more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time insisted on making thoughts of the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team states that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember this ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">That knows them though: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Briton in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of them will win the first and second place within their group of six teams each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will go out of the way for the strong Dutch somewhat longer, which will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising host through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we have been able to ripen the rudder completely." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the torrals in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without winning the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and plunged the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book one goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the triathlete to become a triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's chat in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could certainly have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV ads, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold at the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should have modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse noticed the last 16 years that many of those I had surveyed did not know that it is an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 had been an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the uneducated ear for a clownsschool than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonotic tremor of his never ending benevolent impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampolon, which means" "" "jumping board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hockey and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are rated according to official Olympic program according to design, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 male and 16 female athletes compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go ahead in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another highlight in the television transmission: the world or the Olympique record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir one spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel tiring even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anggling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently proposed - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to get into the air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "demonstrators who call for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shattered the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the response of the government was merciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to combat terrorism beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organizations have continually led the government's oppression - the country's opposition to the country has been curtailed, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Teshome, a tutor in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border reach Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden have been forced to use the turbulence and arm themselves once more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of hinkly under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate over Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered in such protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oroks and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oroks and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who come from aedics predominantly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oroks, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for about 6 percent of the population, dominant in the military, secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North-Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not trust the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which according to statements of analysts apparently were pledged by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ethiopian development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal dispositions of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, managed by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronen flights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump sums up his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who try to protect him during an eventful period of protection, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump retired in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Trump, while he was trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling upheavals.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then to row back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the vote for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive tone because his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading edge in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal co-workers to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocally his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements asked if Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenders, completely wrong and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out by subjecting the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of dealing with each of his words and prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once crowded at the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a cafe in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash, which wasn't Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue shop front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie shop, bought in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local residents smoked it as the last loss in a city of gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excepted and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived club opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing co-worker of the old café, owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do so, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish such as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café does not serve beer anymore, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by awards from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee tines for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "I realised that it was about coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and always ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came fourth after seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no resentment that the soap business took the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "I think we will respond to her offer," "" "said Rodriguez." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he pretends to exhibit them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fancy for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, frictional snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick man, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered minced meat, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," brickman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and poppy bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" traces the ways with which the country was about not to be the land of Cockaigne.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central theme," "" "Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole was a "wonderful way to reuse food leftovers," tile man noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focus of American cuisine for years, became a seldom served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange blends have been tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction has priority over taste or even wholesome cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and bore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Eleanor asked him to take an example of his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the present of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded as soon as the country regained its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, brickman said, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on board of the Sanna research ship, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland shark floats leisurely at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped by slowness, however, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland will be stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-pentpento measured them, when they buried six animals with one transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers, who swing from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, the fisher between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long while the largest was 502 centimeters in size.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks strikingly had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tried to produce large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the length of 220 centimeters in length, the lens nucleus contained a small amount of carbon-14 from the nuclear tests, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, which originates from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai females only get offspring when they are more than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to classify the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-haie with the reproduction obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon at the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Eyachting-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage of all the young strants in two years, the OberministrantenRound St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Several pilgrimage goals have been tested and they finally decided for the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the Holy Year of Mercy on the cathedral of Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Heiligenchambers were on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening earlier, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and informed the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where there was also a Muenster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts in the morning and evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches always made a rest to sing together a song made of specially made pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish halls of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>

<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner restated the final evening in the men's team Sprint at the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that was made by his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. the boy was proud when he stormed home to bring home a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympiahold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the railway world championships in London, despite the Hoys "withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner put an Olympic cord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes fell short after his lap, but Kenny got the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, moving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic circuit in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said Hindu:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the Tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in cycling.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny, who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a prey of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be defeated as a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, with Wiggins focusing on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had been arguing with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Dest, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,0260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong team of trains to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, as the resignation of Shane Sutton, technical director in April, in the midst of sexism and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces for workers - are at stake, as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to forgive any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workplaces in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect as the melt consumption consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelziei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melding with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the treaties were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which would have entered into force from November 2016 onwards." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "hence, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," "" "said the power supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual statement of $187 million in "expectation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to issue the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to run the melt, or to ensure the power supply to the melt," did not interfere.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts "statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 MW and Tomago to consume about 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">San Antonio Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the sought-after September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the clichéd action of almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon girl at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a view to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of existence has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold out of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference similar to a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to the 832 pages of the waltz 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still filtered before official announcement.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "break-through model" of their generation - falls under the former category, is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youth of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success does not like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenny's position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the buggers of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings echoed again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to ride around on the missiut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berlin / Schwerin: survey of countries' elections: losing the SPD and the CDU</seg>
<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), significant losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could scarcely rule in the north, this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite mild losses, the Greens hesitated 6 per cent (previously 8.7 percent) into the Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the parliament at 3 per cent each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Deputies only reached 23 percent (2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They thus still lag behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented at the House of Representatives at 14 percent for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011.</seg>

<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>

<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have previously identified herdlike conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exposed its day-side of the sun for almost two months," "" "said scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "developers of blackmailing malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialist Malwarebytes amongst 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to corporate jackets occurred rapidly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production still stands.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German firms reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand for perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to gain more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed after payment of a few hundred dollars, companies must sometimes negotiate hard and pay 5-digit sums in order to receive their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware-Kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per certified machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually criminals associate spammers with spreading," "" "declares Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware has become known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also gain completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the decon chipper conference, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is falling away.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1,24 metres high from floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel tested with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work slightly quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="19">The security systems include the city emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The high beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign detection and throttles speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep far ahead of the alarm rang.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and over ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as non-restorative.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and many causes can be based on them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, a member of the board of the German Society for Battles and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, however, is insomnia, i.e. an infusion and insomnia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just sleeping feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is sleep disturbance expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common for depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to talk about everyday problems and worries, there's an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with your doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - question.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any lowered sleeping physician in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, she advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise doctors in snoring with respiratory dropouts, in case of inpatient weariness, sleep transducers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cladding, one goes to bed at the normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a probe at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping end on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Woes count on: regular sleeping and uptime, do not sleep too long, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants in the area of the Dusseldorf Airport recognized a band that was known to the police from past theft offenders.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes this year since mid-July and were especially passionate, work-provoking and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminent Commission 34 can prove four acts to the eves, who had been specifically invited to commit crimes to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had taken over 15,000 Euros in total.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few Lindenbäumchen, in between still a remnant cobblestone paving: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like that, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When you walk along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a frescheted kindergarten and a biolad.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, is already built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred in the last few weeks, however, preferably with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's internal senator Henkel has been advocating for a strong action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go Zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three team-cars on site, unlocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled off the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">This summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open up between the occupants and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which, even today compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and pollinators from all over the world in recent years: residents from East-GDR times and former home owners are now sharing their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on discarded discs or freshly painted facades, which were raised with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the criminal offences make property damage, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who were not sure.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous fuel-burning cars no longer exist in the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been consciously drawn into the Riga Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former building blocks that crowd the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are, in the end, condominiums which are not interesting for many of them - here people who are not so well-contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who goes into a pub district, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups for refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the discarving Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking than for the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to write the passage.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an affording Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it concerns organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports genuine and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find flats for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accomodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these properties have to be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the Land Department to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not functioned so far, so it is necessary to rely on private dwellings, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings need to be intimidated as it is said to be so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine reported.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no occupational therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But work doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers like sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and honorary officials jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">If somebody at some point develop the feeling he can't help anybody in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problems, says the customer," "" "People with whom nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two fears of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small congregation like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine's customer says quite clearly, "what some naïve might call." a residual risk can and may not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins will completely revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So Haupt- and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clearly to be answered, the politics abhor.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach yet, where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been utilized to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
