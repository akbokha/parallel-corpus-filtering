Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the meeting also aims to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal struck by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress held a controversial speech , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting with reference to the election that was ahead in Israel was rejected .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who had been in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university associates have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb once made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic distress call .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motiv@@ ating .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested Lamb naturally killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he received his doctorate in education in spring .
one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ standing friends described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both appearing on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he was filming Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on the night of 5th September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were swe@@ ating and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , a professor of English at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the Univers@@ it√© &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season

Michael J. Fox ch@@ oked about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realized that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm length from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie the@@ aters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addressing the crisis in Syria , B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey figures showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have turned it off as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was submitted to the ascending Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some recent surveys that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has noted last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anger@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination say after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July were putting their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it is clear that a large number of GO@@ P voters view Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even when the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps guidance , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates diff@@ use .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have strongly committed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinions are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will hold decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ lands .
at the time of Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters is eliminated , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa @-@ Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ cont@@ ented . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in Hob@@ look@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residence - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
in the street , a square metre of a prec@@ ast house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special situations one square meter costs most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student &apos;s book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top dwelling places , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂l@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here , exceptionally .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂tz@@ e
dual scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just a barrel run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then ran it .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂tz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers doubles pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ s + 2 ) and G√∂tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
M√ºller received a gracious help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto in the Champions League for his 28th position in the Champions League to lead a shot of the world champion thought out as Flan@@ ke .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based words .
they showed a concentrated and engaged idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the Royal class , including rep@@ utable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they proce@@ eded cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offen@@ sives efforts they were often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks have often been initiated by game shift on the left side of Douglas Costa , rarely passed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
M√ºller had more luck from the right side than his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians pulled up their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to make con@@ i@@ fers .
but Manuel Neu@@ er &apos;s goal was to be reli@@ eved .
for example , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ ath ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New , Guardi@@ ola left a four chain chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario G√∂tz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light after finishing training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to make something different is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , guar@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , M√ºller still put one on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ l@@ ame Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c evi@@ dently provoked the supporters of the hosts of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich adher@@ ents .
at least one Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , do not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when doing so , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in smo@@ kers compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphasizes the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gum inflammation in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment falls again to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has affected DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter fragments of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity on the Rhine river banks
for the second time archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the start of the construction work on the Rhine .
at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is constantly added as a department for archaeological ground preservation .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard archae@@ ologists have now been discovered .
it was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church .

European Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to resolve the dispute over the proposed TT@@ IP trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for con@@ ten@@ tions between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against convic@@ tions .
so far , the parties involved agree among themselves on arbit@@ rators , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their sentences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ str√∂m commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she plans to work towards an International Investment Court according to his own data .
there could then , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded , above all by large corporations , is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies are subjected to damage compensation to tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or en@@ force a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised mainly that they are not supposed to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed Malm@@ str√∂m &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of action of the economy by too many new rules .
as a result , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks about the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer acceptable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy and acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gri@@ pped by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us on the basis of various places he always records on the map , which reports his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they have ar@@ isen and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be wonderfully creative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs appear that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late 1960s but can always drift into great opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of states should be occupied in a sequence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
he live on guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the New York @-@ based musician returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece is published in 2005 .
thinking of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic links .
this sixth neat studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
as soon as the smaller clubs have sprung up , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage d√©@@ cor .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though almost 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to give thanks to St@@ ev@@ ens , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally til@@ ting under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the PM of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Q &amp; D and will first join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as she comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour president &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of Shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the European Union &apos;s position and the restriction in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said that Labour was propos@@ ing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of ¬£ 26@@ ,000 to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch Box during the last decade .
the Labour Chair , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is to be con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; skill &quot; and the stri@@ fe with bar@@ b@@ arians and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , who will represent him as a shadow economic minister , if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch P@@ unch &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he acknowledged that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the survey was regarded with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose br@@ ittle according to data , which indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was hei@@ gh@@ tened by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the outcome without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest at the time of an interest increase since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v had been received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had placed his assessment of the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
J@@ D Sports CEO says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition to Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
pol@@ ite 21 years young , a suspension with a top fat@@ eful f@@ ume .
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavily .
rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and Generation U@@ 17 rot@@ ates through .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ski .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you live I@@ dol whose posters are attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the Suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs just as much on the day her m@@ um E@@ wa ear@@ ns for half a year .

compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who is it it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bie@@ ber herself does not .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
for the advertisement in the promotional print of the super market he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company paid a lot of dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber likewise c@@ ashed .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Ben@@ ber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to third place .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster puts Lebanese on a potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂ner ?
it goes both - in the potato h@@ √∂ner , that the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop a barbecue is spinning , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the Lebanese has meanwhile submitted the idea to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches So@@ il St@@ ability Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a fund@@ raising campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of an 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will release more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler performs its annual investment strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment .
there is a lot of stake in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA outlets and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut about five per cent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on a high fixed cost base of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash would disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operating debt reduction at equal pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equ@@ alize sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers by improving their stores through fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging remedi@@ ation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis feder@@ ator Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly praise his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight due to the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gy@@ ne with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ting : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ ne , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite avi@@ d is the fact that in my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute a bit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mat@@ ured young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z when deciding on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick made a quick rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and ear@@ ns all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency status , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency stand and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land between the two control points of the countries for an unknown time and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c on a controversial meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand located on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison inhabitants were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point into the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , into a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , expected for next week , but reports from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ setting off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are busy rep@@ airing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to penetrate there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of voters in primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders stands second with 27 percent ( 17 percent rise ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the pres@@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion states what candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ ander now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the voters in the pre @-@ elections nationwide say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
it may not be surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled by her .
the views are more mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the voters of the prim@@ aries say that they enthusias@@ tically support Clinton , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman &apos;s president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approval to deal with the problems and elec@@ tors are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the Democrats &quot; nom@@ ination , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead is S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ector &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like last month , no single democratic candidate or candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries still stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results in some of the important features of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best deals with hon@@ esty among the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions relating to H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views overall .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public in total .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinions were still deteri@@ or@@ ating .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting citizens see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ differently rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is eliminated , and others are losing a lot of support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son flew from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and that Tr@@ ump sur@@ passes Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wiscon@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen most of the time , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in poll@@ s - he ends with 19 % support among Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a show show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people can no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean : in the east , there is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people are filed .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood brut@@ ally attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with a bl@@ unt force injury to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of attacking and forming a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ official - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has withdrawn its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest rates , and the domestic economy will fall , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
thus , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a higher rate of interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset income will be accounted for 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to net interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Chef System Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expected this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have prepared a net interest rate for the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade will only have a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions are set very fast after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond@@ ages fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter loans closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones believes the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit margins have expanded and volati@@ lity continues - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy .
as a whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts stated in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed a weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed out the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maintains a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ ca@@ ster does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that hard work had to be done to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory Member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the bill bills for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones to redeem
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed down editions in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sale index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ der websites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that a little more than ¬£ 1 was spent online at ¬£ 5 .
some products , such as TV and washing machines , are now being conducted over a third of purchases via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first install@@ ments in Mec@@ ca
Saudi Arabia partially distor@@ ts the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
gri@@ eving filled , mostly dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed by the holy site , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the beds .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi king passed a sanc@@ tion on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 persons who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was supported .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already agreed that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was banned .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the overthrow of the sick that rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also cul@@ min@@ ated the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid heavy winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once required in the life of any sound Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million gi@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded get half of this amount .

V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , has now out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are dedicated to professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are hit by women .
for the moment , the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to focus on the growing demographic trends that have more female single households which make more recent renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this to balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed company in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group cleared the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president A@@ ich / D@@ ob , Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president , have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the def@@ end@@ ants had found out that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants used funds of club accounts , which they could disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact was rejected by the president of the Sho@@ v@@ elling Senate , the judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
in order to refuse the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the non @-@ profit organisation was not an asset to the society at any time .
the sports officials had only charged expense allow@@ ances and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we carry on or stop the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of the chief audi@@ tor of the finance office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , only no debt can be made .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allow@@ ances had been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allow@@ ances was paid out only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was in the account .
therefore , package and not detailed interrup@@ tions seemed to be the same , the former chairman explained the events .
the accounts and savings accounts administered the two accused together , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of finance , it is important that the absence of debt has been important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against which the official investigations started , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the bank account .
that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know this for a long time .
then he finally thought he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself .
this transfer has been formulated as a &quot; damage compensation . &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and public prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never obtained a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were unable to provide accurate documentation for the early years .
according to a plant audit , in which everything was considered correct , they were no longer kept , they declared .
the second accused was also covered by mil@@ eage .
all the adjustments had to be made in cash , in order to do so , he said in his statement of his place of residence to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff reductions that have been ongoing for three years , the company will disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting up the company .
there is no end to the sub@@ missions at the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) computer centre .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 locations in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard shares sold 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the corporation , which has grown up with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printing business is to be bund@@ led in a new society even this year - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a more dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services eventually became the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , the revenues decreased in 15 from 16 quarters .
HP answers with a cle@@ av@@ age and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more shops online .
the total reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs is fores@@ een by the Whit@@ man restructuring plans .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly be rejected : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 per cent showed cons@@ enting .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
24 percent , on the other hand , are to intervene in the conflict .
in collaboration with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents declined , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the heart of the fair , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility are at the heart of the fair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connect mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA Auto Association expect around 900 000 visitors .
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police employed a number of hundreds of refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and water@@ shed .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line was formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water @-@ thro@@ wer ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to officials .
the officers initially stopped the pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sl@@ umped together and suffered under short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ men , too , suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US staff comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether or not for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was the last week of the opinion that the F@@ ed will continue to do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current level will hold from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less corro@@ sive outlook on global relations .
it has warned the markets to focus on an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at the Delta State University left inde@@ struc@@ ted letter
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency center that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give an explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen picked him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in the spring of 2015 from the University of Delta State University , as his life @-@ law gives to the university &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm

in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor allegedly ordered drugs to fight , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group aims to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrades the low @-@ cost Euro wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
the board of directors headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the responsibility of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Pass@@ Airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations after the court @-@ stopped strike will resume on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to come as quickly as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline resulted in several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transition supply of the drivers , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ agus concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is lag@@ ging over the Group &apos;s own tri@@ g@@ line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven champi@@ ons League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outer def@@ enders to cry and exclu@@ des it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had burst into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it will take six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United er@@ ects the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron is better acquainted with The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , re@@ produces a summary of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the cov@@ eting Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , sle@@ ek @-@ bear@@ ded creature , &quot; speaking in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral desk .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , repe@@ ating the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not finish a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I have said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th could have been prolonged , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t achieve such good performances and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set out Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the status of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making mos@@ ques in addition to Cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ punch and get four squ@@ e@@ cks , turned up and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may have not done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he strai@@ gh@@ tened three hundred of R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spinning centers that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen to be young .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ lah Jay@@ na@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .

the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy enters a l@@ ull by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ prepared ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who was heavily crushed for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own guilt , the UK itself created agenda with split concessions and troubles@@ ome treaty changes , most of which do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the over@@ drive long endu@@ ms like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or re @-@ election in 2017 .
he is also a verbal force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some such ministers may even deliberately plan un@@ helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing out of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did during the referendum of 1975 inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can &apos;t remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro conci@@ li@@ ator , who has made himself a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ i@@ ght ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ itting ali@@ ens and pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners , most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that if you sit in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had accepted the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a backdoor .
the press never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional da@@ zz@@ ling and wil@@ der fav@@ ours by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father worked on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the cri@@ mp@@ ed bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a ne@@ sting site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe allowing him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ie Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home in all .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health UK via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) were joining Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his main conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring about their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors previously received from British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 atten@@ de@@ es at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence until now that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds a year .
by clear preliminary evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ poin@@ ter , says former head of Channel 4
former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ man and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows in their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC general director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without any success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly demonstrated by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least place your production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ man is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts return what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like S@@ East@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their seemingly holy missions for justification of ¬£ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the radio fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value here for ¬£ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the ¬£ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; inform , train and maintain . &quot;
he said only little of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of the public television channels in Australia and Canada in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and talking . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels responding to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the method of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the reinforced ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the th@@ rows .
the sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms to wear some of their TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultras@@ onic applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was astonished about the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade - by a leave of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic competitive corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I still went to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those who have anger@@ ed me - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the adv@@ ent in student residen@@ ces ranges from easy to nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell whence you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ bat@@ year where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly don &apos;t love or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
people are often transformed into drinks recipes , film nights venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and groom their under@@ wear .
related This refers to : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I spent for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of t@@ apping .
talking about kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ ek .
as you start the university at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less strange as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to bake for you . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say self @-@ serving , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if they did something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with still loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , get rid of her , get rid of her and then have to see her every day , and perhaps see how she draws together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the border between an el@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments to get to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never do one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut their doors and put their keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le their properties on the ceiling no more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ income servers
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ locker builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the bene@@ fici@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build still cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ lian , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ lis : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great part .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees we need sufficient living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
guil@@ ds : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you teach people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ lis : I have correctly crossed my project .
particularly complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Ord@@ in@@ ance Regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who in a row house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place lacking .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced building project ?
Gil@@ lis : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ lis : it &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the lesser slave .
I show you how to build and build well today .
that &apos;s what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean deletion of apps to create room - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may shut down half@@ way and may result in a down@@ turn in the update .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly @-@ leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second pointed out ahead of the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the world champion before reti@@ ring in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and will also hit the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the present smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .

district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly care centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have come together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice from now on receive information on questions such as the nursing insurance or services of the health and nursing homes .
for years , with our ambul@@ ant care service , we have established that nursing relatives are often left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house owner J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ella and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the sen@@ iors centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this is because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure necessary in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings as possible .
the lod@@ g@@ ings office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnstler@@ haus is an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as was stated in the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design from 1972 to 1983 .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned by the Treas@@ ury Chamber in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and rev@@ amped the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

according to his own statement , he wants 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the contrary , he has not added intellec@@ tually .
he had just cut his hair in the inner city of Bremen when he saw a parking space guard out there for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , the police ran away from the shop , insul@@ ted the officials and threw away the fine fine of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
the city of Bremen shows the accus@@ ations that the consequences for the unusual occurrence are not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beat a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men shou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a n@@ os@@ ef@@ al break in this case and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he first let down his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and passed by demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the aid of a stroke , one checked on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
to date , only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been around 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over Practice Fel@@ ice breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ ig@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sti@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing in many places in the country : Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ sti@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sti@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller will open its practice again on October 12th , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St Mar@@ cell@@ us stra√üe 6 .
it was a sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic at first sight when the field students met Frank M√ºller and his wife , Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ zi@@ l , who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and will also come into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ th@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the M√ºller couple liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the clos@@ eness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so they agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
nevertheless , they will continue to live in Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank M√ºller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed up stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19 , the practice is being prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle themselves as a general practitioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ zi@@ l .
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be awarded to the mill@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ or@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients enter the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average level there are about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone .
he who visits M√ºller &apos;s office hours also continues to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already feels a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband laugh@@ ingly compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed against gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border checks are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the care and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a need for clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refuses to &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue travelling to Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not aiming to close its borders to refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to enter eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is predominantly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country reck@@ ons with around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was to suggest the people to suggest specific routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the way through Serbia all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary added , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west stretch .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible withdrawal situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday at a local manifest@@ o in Hor@@ gos : he susp@@ ects the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
support for migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers were sent to the border region .

in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some people spontaneously resort to the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; can read the war , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not suffering long , &quot; others stay short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , it is understandable that not everyone on the boards would share publicly , but finally it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death still remains with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people .

the death and funeral assistant belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .

when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid was looking for volunteers by calling Ehren@@ am@@ pler , she immediately reported and had been involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point of view , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training and further education and supervision of the death and funeral companions .

the plaques described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .

the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on January 4 , and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ transporting heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings if we take into account the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which forec@@ asted twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the h@@ acks questioned analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent for the bo@@ d@@ transport , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labor costs in freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ min@@ ent over them at one end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story seat @-@ hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here keep stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the business data show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to reinfor@@ ce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts den@@ ite the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good path to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress to increase the sentence .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world sent together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
in May , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average figure fell by more than 16 % below its peak when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered a bit this month , with the D@@ ow now almost 10 % below May .
for the reed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy wouldn &apos;t have occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will impact the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed became the monetary authority of the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow down its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also discuss with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the Asset Management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
varnish , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a rise in interest rates , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market composition , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate deposit .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a rise in interest because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should hurry .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are also a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with both body and soul .
she is still fond of teaching her 74 L@@ enses .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is a different lesson than at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS aims to clarify women in a shock@@ ing way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy child &apos;s diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited sports hall construction on Bern@@ ried &apos;s Sport@@ complex is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without much discussion .
before that , the committee had , among other things , decided to apply for a statutory &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; and &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ im@@ movable first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the tilt of the roof , which was required for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - to lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof inclin@@ ation permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Municipal Council generally has more restric@@ tive power on exemp@@ tion motions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in the field of sports hall construction , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of schools and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the Land Council for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
when asked who to follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this meant a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
over the next two years , if the supervisory board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses , then next year , the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
coun@@ tra@@ itor J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the German Chamber of Commerce , will in future be used as housing for asylum @-@ seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quasi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and comprehen@@ sively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years .
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

hunting case with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the harvest on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police informed .
after a shot , a 63@@ h@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were put into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave him the chance to kill the young people and to have thrown their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police announced on Wednesday .
as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also suspected of giving the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ gation in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people , there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ en@@ ant reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses placed in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be presented to the prison fun@@ nel on Wednesday , and the investig@@ ators put him under arrest .
conclusions about the near@@ er circumstances of the act are to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid place .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Socialist housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are ready in Germany this year .
140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first accommodation facility .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing estate policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit which grows from year to year .
currently , around 7@@ 70@@ ,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore live in big cities not@@ rated in room@@ mate rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ ull on the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Socialist housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
in this way , the Property Tax@@ ation Tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments may be suspended .
according to the alliance , attractive tax depreciation possibilities are also necessary .
the Kf@@ W support programme for refugee camps is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available ‚Ç¨ 300 million had been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no longer a transit , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Interior Minister , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the sh@@ ot@@ ting of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have moved to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe .
500 people have crossed the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
on the day before Hungary , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
moreover , new laws which entered into force on the same day ren@@ ders ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
just before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws consider overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set up on the border ended on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there had been 40 refugees there .
practically nobody has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
barrier gri@@ lles were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after the government &apos;s declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people wait for the continuation to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were occupied with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pas@@ sau .
because Germany had surprisingly hired rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in the end for them , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the near Pas@@ sau .
prior to that , we only once sti@@ fl@@ ed the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we just said , we bring them by car to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview .
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the str@@ anded pas@@ sage@@ ways increased in W@@ els from an ICE train to a regional train in the direction of Pas@@ sau on Sunday evening , in order to try the short @-@ term pro@@ clamation that rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was shut down in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ally , day before , a two @-@ bridge @-@ run spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n has now sent thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparently holy policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of supporting R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke immediately upon the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly backed the position of the Hungarian government into the non @-@ governmental sphere of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
the Chaos in the first acceptance center in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was also carried out without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ .000 quar@@ tz@@ es in the he@@ ur@@ ish year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had discussions with the country captains .
they had promised him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born and will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also has great expectations in the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that district employers have to respect a certain amount of towel holders or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad gave his experience that he was more successful in opposition to the Ministry of the Interior .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further to face the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness was his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the Republic as they themselves declared .
their number of employees is to increase them to three to four .
the own search for districts has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as office .
however , there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz demands a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected persons can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the city chief has critic@@ ised the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ ded further proceedings in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the appropriate border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees in Germany will not give it any more for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the asylum seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2,@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology segment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup firms of the New Wer@@ ft and later on which to acquire them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from where Nieder@@ haus@@ er is promising : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
S &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop , fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cade : after all , she has now grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la Shop opposite the shop where it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything is now about ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site , in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the big city of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ tures when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional lady can &apos;t answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag enhances any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place where residents are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become a U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ups .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , jar@@ red on journalists or reveal gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Pres@@ idency stir@@ s up the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the P@@ √§l@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ eh@@ fresh@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term in the win@@ emaking village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him over -@@ zig ends .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , among whom Tr@@ ump also counts the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the small town within a radius , called &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
first real estate purchases in New York were the cor@@ nerst@@ one of the real estate group .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian state , to which the Rhin@@ eland was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because once he was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension host@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which generally arrived well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not gain the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who were in the US at the time of his grandfather had been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah B√ºh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinema @-@ go@@ ers , also in the USA is awakening interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper @-@ Bavarian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park on Wednesday received the award for soft tourism from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rus@@ hed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull succeeded in over@@ throwing Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Sunrise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five capitals compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , today , the vulner@@ ability of Sunrise has closed in recent months .
in August , today we reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 by Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 ran out .
sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators stands at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wi@@ dow@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven was strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half @-@ hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may not know@@ ingly reveal who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three , you might have accidentally given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood seals his lips firmly to the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who was to get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could their answers become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made her clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday at 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t on Tuesday at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to an Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the current game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his ple@@ ated catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the tre@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ light 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut back then in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al range led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

because of the high number of refugees , the Free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn retreat in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get awards in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free vot@@ er conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free Di@@ elec@@ torate @-@ Meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Di@@ vot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer the free voters as soon as possible .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ pers@@ expan@@ i district , approximately 175 miles west of Kath@@ mandu capital .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately obvious why the rubber shells used , known to be able to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last week of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plain , where members of the ethnic group of the People of Madagascar say that new provinces , formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ der Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be repaired again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
correspon@@ dingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ stra√üe / Corner Big Street , already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
P@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the Holiday House on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor first presented plans for the project .
some residents are more worried - they fear the sale of their leisure space
for months had been negotiated behind closed doors , slan@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday house on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the interested person , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on to the offensive by the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ den@@ keepers , who had come to the meeting , produced the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the board of the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cla@@ d that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus loads have to come so that it pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well @-@ ac@@ re area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the building plans were still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : physicians without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global money raised to $ 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn down by the war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diab@@ e@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight relative to size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dissolved and 28 % were partially dissolved .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely reduced by only one percent and partially only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally were better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the patient &apos;s blood glucose level of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.1 ) and ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obesity is about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ √ºck
it is an issue that is currently increasingly popular in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times , and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ √ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader encouraged him to stop the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US reported about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low a strong alcohol disinf@@ ect@@ ant , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in need of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection agents with alcohol containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , a few sp@@ lashes of alcohol pois@@ oning can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic emergency center in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in H@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let go about swal@@ lowing whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry du@@ ck @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was put into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold seen by an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lam@@ ented her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and ki@@ cked her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection clothes and to store suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by decl@@ aring anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bore D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with five points lead , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel this exactly the way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was later aboli@@ shed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have commented no performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive League victory , giving them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table , thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in pots or le@@ agues that have not won the games of this kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it rises in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( O@@ NS ) showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except in a late j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ aft lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she acknowledged that she could have better form@@ ulate it , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ bag@@ y , a repor@@ ter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the casts of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after a damp police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace incident in Becken@@ ried .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about getting his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end the race .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt up@@ take in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a more trainer .
I must then consider what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ al@@ Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me the opinion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps do people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and inf@@ ringe myself , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels were established with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching resulted in the fact that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s legs , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been last night .
it could have been around yesterday the whole day , which was also the case .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fighting back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised Tac@@ kl@@ ing as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ering of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was confident of him , as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s coming up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring games when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; says Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real center of gravity , and that has yiel@@ ded the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the storm team is free at this weekend , because they have won the right to either receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and put on in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the caf√© could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mac@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in common to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and keeps himself at an exit block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house tear@@ ing apart
in the event of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate from the last moment to the left , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident origin@@ ator tore apart complet@@ ly .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce p@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ t used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the telephone lack@@ ed and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it was an ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten the ped@@ ophi@@ le .
after his conversations , he was asked by the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the runs on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; is to be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgement until October , in order to obtain background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the sentence .
slu@@ ice switches to small cross @-@ border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
for fear of discovery and arrest , many floo@@ d@@ houses made people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in Land@@ kreise ( Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn ) along the border river Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot via bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
compared to the week of the week , the Munich central station met again significantly more refugees than in the beginning of the week .
some 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be a for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area on Western Europe , currently warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; Henry &quot; Trop@@ ic tree , which was pulled over the Atlantic in the last days from the Bermuda Islands .
violent storms and storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ se@@ abed with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour , the DW@@ D can be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the automobile manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , it is particularly important to see movement in the compact cars , which are currently selling particularly well .
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : approx . 28@@ ,@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Technology ( Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August in this segment .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Publi@@ cation Days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view that starts at 17,@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra costs ‚Ç¨ 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor M√©@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and under@@ lined sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan dealer wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts perfectly to the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt , is also new in the segment .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to the manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , who had spent months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint : he was housed at the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres of ground surface ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after this , the man , who is now on the loose foot after his lawyer &apos;s information , had been moved to a larger cell .
his official position due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Court Court in Berlin and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity wounded .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if there were only a few days of custody for compensation for legal reasons , compensation for compensation was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a til@@ lage of the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they only said in April a det@@ ain@@ ee damages claim because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to human dignity , a decision of 2011 is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a homogeneous cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons also hit the head@@ lines due to missing personnel .
therefore , det@@ ain@@ ees are always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even massac@@ res must have occurred due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of offspring , 19 are to be dropped in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what &apos;s coming to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview provides an overview of what is to be achieved in Germany .
according to forecasts of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments are needed annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
however , the lack of living space is dramatic , above all with affordable rental objects : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price per year , and these particularly advantageous homes will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is agreement between scientists and the Federal Minister of Agriculture in the fact that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in Germany the refugees are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ u@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ u@@ ck@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residence duty , which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the view is mostly realised that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
until now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted by personal contacts .
for this reason , the construction of networks is the Royal Path to work integration , according to the opinion of Thr@@ itt@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few fled parents gave their children to the kit@@ ita , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parents rooted it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
students without knowledge of German language are prepared for instruction in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by teachers who are fully educated , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
grant refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a refund or debt do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start a course of studies .
in principle , the latter do not receive a liability because they do not fall under the circle of eligible individuals .
tolerated refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years to be eligible to be eligible , from 1 January 2016 this can be shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually abandon the same rights to Islam as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also involves the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole of society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany undertake must become a reality in the coming years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the currently expected refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks everyone to issue health cards immediately when registering .
services provided could later be settled with the Bundes@@ l√§nder .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to extract as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , doctors mainly make language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be covered .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in the case of refugee camps , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV education .
but with the partly other illnesses , German doctors still come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the doctors &apos; struggle is concerned , the refugees may possibly even allevi@@ ate relief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed education system , and several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly disc@@ ard trials again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ eu Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by TU M√ºnchen shows that every fifth Syrian refugee problem arrives traumati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from , among other things , so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardiac pac@@ ing and death thro@@ ats .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , up to now only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers can apply for a psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ical workers or doctors , who are not educated for psychological disorders , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to capture every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the brick of the bun@@ ny .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my Circus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for lovers is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km @-@ long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to take up loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tip feeling and artic@@ ulation .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sli@@ mming people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics just like little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst took a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not going well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , are read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
the upper@@ most commandment , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little JU@@ MB@@ O was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 viewers , we always do our best and are with their whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to meet your expectations from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , it is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also uph@@ eld by the asser@@ tions of opposition from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ kin .
last month , they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will divide into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering previously un@@ achieved , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to deal with the revers@@ al of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
he emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as long as his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his involvement in the next summer on the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have suffered most injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will continue throughout the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an over@@ due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal are clear favour@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger &apos;s opinion is that ar@@ senal drew the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far @-@ off hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said .
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy @-@ show , which gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a group of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communicating via social media , with its focus on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football watching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee in phone pastoral care , I explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened with suicide has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the fully re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani in his case against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria joins the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ parking Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that , they missed a number of opportunities before they finally lifted their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a boun@@ ce in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which on the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense , before he passed down to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off fought to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field excited a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went by Kevin Tra@@ pps pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes reli@@ ed on , with some mis@@ prints and bad conclusions , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who , in no less than five experiments , scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the restart .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that turned Di Maria into a shot , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth end of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had opened a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and in the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has completed a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League that does not have the same level .
the qualification matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented from moving to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champi@@ ons , four times Champions League winner , twice world champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already before the European Championship 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for that works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed guar@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , he got me thri@@ lled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 was running with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass , turned the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it in filling the film and not in filling the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the comments of the acting actor by The Mar@@ tian fes@@ tiv@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - who ever will be the director - how to handle the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said at first .
the only black person , and she is a ring@@ ed , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People prevailed for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that is SO WH@@ ITE it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet has earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation and , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hatred .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ esses who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pop@@ e is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th Season , has never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or lived more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m happy that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh time , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who lost a Two @-@ Run to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the leading 27th time in this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit added a insurance run at the end of the ninth interior , the wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ anders , however , scra@@ pe S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I was releasing and feeling that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player , Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers scored in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he got the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ics of A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder joint , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is cancelled from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he was missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening .
it counted 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
only over the past ten days , according to the pres@@ idency of the government of Gie@@ √üen , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he presented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective route &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had gone by a military turn@@ out in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on the southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , no one is sent back to Hungary .
Germany , too , did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the question of an agreement , which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for the next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees in a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee sending in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hour discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lines that those people who need protection are also getting it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who do not have a lasting perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view had been strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer border with Serbia during the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania had to be crossed with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary wanted to prevent ski@@ ppers from seeking alternative routes through Romania , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ at about the planned new border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , there were thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border .

this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; space probe .
the moon is therefore slightly stag@@ ger on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this de@@ af movement is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade journal .
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .

at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

he who eats the fruits thus supports ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too tight and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .

the US parcel service UPS provides up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , UPS announced on Tuesday .
especially drivers are being sought .
last year , UPS had raised its staff for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 late deliveries had made harsh criticism of the parcel service .
first blow , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night the F@@ √∂hn breaks in the valleys of the alpine side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland communicated on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and night on Thursday the F@@ √∂hn blows partly with storm strength through the F@@ √∂hn@@ wel@@ valleys .
after the bo@@ oming on Thursday morning , a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rain , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently located on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest flow .
on the mountain side of the Alps , the F@@ √∂hn breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ ills with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can penetrate up to the neighboring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even orders of hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the alpine slope begins to st@@ ow away .
here rain sets in , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , South of the Alps will have to be reck@@ oned with over 100 litres of rain per square meter over the next 48 hours , after large amounts of rain have already fallen over the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ √∂hn runs out , in the consequence a cold front with strong , partially thunder@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland rolls .
together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .
the following days are presented in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther seat in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now recognized as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es could often live as a minority as a minority only in un@@ seen faith .
with the place , in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that the tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten sin b@@ abel .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then began the division of the Western Church with his theses against aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles dedicated to subjects such as the Way of the Cross , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewellery binding has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work this way , in order not to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to make art more important again in a faster time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertising , and it is noisy .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he can understand life with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not taken care to fully comprehend the Bible , but also chosen the most important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; it was a picture Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
part of the original - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X train
plans made , place found , company commissioned , ground be@@ eper mod@@ elled for a round trip : a year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration caused a dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill de@@ ported , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permission will take place in October , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was able to inform Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is setting a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its assistance in tac@@ kl@@ ing the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to intensively discuss the situation of refugees in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery tomorrow and meet the Minister of State Mrs. √ñ@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
but the decisive points must be politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professionals place a clear sign when they will bear the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di V√∂@@ ller &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is all about , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can , no , we must use our jet force , influence , and possibilities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the European Championship on Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed ver@@ eine had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the German federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have rec@@ alled the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye through a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bled , was power@@ less , then tow@@ ed out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo , &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully fit for work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren Re@@ placement Pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he comes as a spare car for the two of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button during the night race in Singapore on the weekend , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the FK K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the BV@@ B coach was open on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel v. Le@@ verk@@ usen : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem el@@ elf on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change at the door &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of ancest@@ or Roman b√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el has been open to whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe league games .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ fer Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l understandable : &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the IAA Motor Show in Frankfurt on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio coverage .
to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as a driver .
with automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected only far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Transport politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the investig@@ ator organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect this at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents face up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the USA .
in Germany , drivers are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could mean at least 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 per cent .
good every fourth would not leave the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says Team and Double @-@ Start at Table Tennis Championships
according to the present state of the title , the D√ºsseldorf @-@ based D√ºsseldorf will only be able to strike a single one from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision should be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf in D√ºsseldorf during the European semester . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; explained single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the se@@ ed@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the fifth @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was met in a tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old player of Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ och pointed to a sl@@ ump break .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures gr@@ us@@ el@@ cab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I was the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was taken : to fro@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a Sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot took 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
Gau@@ l &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative , fashionable sal@@ aries of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught fashion designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
he did not have the opportunity to pay for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewels instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example on blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working alone , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en run@@ ni .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning of the P@@ lau@@ dry tip fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now being discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls several examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called Vintage Mode , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic epo@@ chs , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialized shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer on this road .
nowadays , mass production is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively by chains .
moreover , export is weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year , we are introducing a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg Exc@@ ept of the West@@ s√§chs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design often only varies slightly in order to maintain a customer base .
some years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historical snow@@ ball tip .
the machine cle@@ ars small balls at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ dry gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ dry tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who want to commemor@@ ate .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a re @-@ film but a kind of continuation which is played 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already stands firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central management group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ass@@ uring a right @-@ state business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as announced in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to account for a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
the F@@ ood@@ watch consumer organisation , which has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve pois@@ oning for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this relaxation , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are mostly so low that they already comply with the planned limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts particularly in un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets into the environment mainly due to coal burning .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet the Green @-@ German Parliament Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
