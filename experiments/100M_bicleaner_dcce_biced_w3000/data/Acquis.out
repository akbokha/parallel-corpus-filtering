&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this Agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures necessary for the implementation of the provisions of the part I concerning the securing measures .
the aim of the procedures of the safety measures specified in this Convention is the timely detection of significant quantities of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a separation by the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the objective specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the inspections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity assigned for a certain period of time is specified under specification of accuracy limits for the indicated me@@ gen .
in carrying out their inspections , the organization makes full use of the community &apos;s safegu@@ arding system after Article 3 .
the collection and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures will make use of the following ways and , as far as necessary , see how they are near@@ er and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , sent , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ;
( B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) methods for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) methods for ass@@ essing the accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and report system , which exhibits the core material inventory and changes in this inventory , including the input and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Procedure for the reporting of reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures under this Convention do not cover material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circulation described under letter c ) is introduced into the states , the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving the core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues , the organisation and the community consult each other about the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the Organization and the Community are unanim@@ ous that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
upon request of the Community , the Organization shall release the following core material from the securing measures pursuant to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) nuclear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire core material delivered in the States is at no time more than that of this Article in the States .
a ) a total of one kilogram of special p@@ inning material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and over the amount of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with the core material which is subject to the securing measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope which is necessary for the successful and effective support of the tasks of the Organization pursuant to this Convention , in the individual as the procedures prescribed in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without amend@@ ment of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all the efforts to make these agreements enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report stated in article 62 , the organization sets up a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the security measures of this Convention in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory by the following reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
( GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement .
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Trade Account &quot; consisting of the funds made by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special action account ; this account is referred to as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; by the organization , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transactions account is separately and separately guided by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization &apos;s deposit .
B ) The payment is made in two rates ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution of 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may , upon request , make payments prior to the aforementioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately .
with the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without any benefits ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly @-@ paid development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and managed for the funding loans funded by the organization , with the purpose stated under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ord@@ al means by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , in ten free years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization they retain .
each transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is given .
the recei@@ pts from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator decided at the time of loan granted , could be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator .
the administrator has informed the EEC as far as the complete aband@@ on@@ ment of all transactions is provided by the directors in preparation and through the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the administrator maintains the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses paid for this .
as soon as possible , the car@@ et@@ aker noti@@ fies the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organisation for this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC is informed as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transactions account .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrators up to the full issue of the funds of the transaction account from time to time give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transactions account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the Organisation were not entered into force , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all transactions claimed by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States have notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a notification regarding the proper authorisation of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the above qualifications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two Ur@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wording is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter exchange for amend@@ ment of Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issued the following CH@@ AN@@ GE :

I invite you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you confirm the approval of your government to the above .
I invite you to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit transactions with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries , when banks submit a corresponding request .
the agreement could be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , within a total amount of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future distribution equity fund of the member countries .
however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , to which the BI@@ S would be ready .
in every stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ing extensions without having to exceed a total of five years .
in the event of the opening of the loans as well as for their possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws are not made before the end of one month after the end of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .

the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could adver@@ sely affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community has taken precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance on Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lambs are only given in accordance with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .

the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the quantity applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina .

I invite me to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the determination of the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community relating to the application of the common market organization for sheep and goat meat by the community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties have agreed as follows :
- Fresh or chill@@ ed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ center 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common tari@@ ff tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen chicken - , lamb - and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ center 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common tari@@ ff tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set for the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the agreed quantity does not exceed the quantity agreed and executed in accordance with the traditional offer forms ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community uses the safeguard clause , it is obliged to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the import from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products written by this agreement to a ho@@ ax rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay alters the amount specified in number 2 according to the scope of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with every new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 named ho@@ unds of exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount stated under number 2 is determined by Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could adver@@ sely affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ skin .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lambs are only given in accordance with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the Interpretation and Application of the VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by giving the quantities of export lic@@ ences defined in this agreement for the products mentioned under the number 1 .
the Community , in its turn , under@@ takes to make all necessary arrangements so that the issuing of import licenses for the aforementioned products originated in Uruguay depending on the template of an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing provisions , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals conc@@ edes the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; these data may be en@@ forced to destination country if necessary .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic Ö@@ st@@ lich des Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 in terms of changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you confirm the agreement of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or other substance specified on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) here@@ tical properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured with repeated di@@ lution of the agent to be investigated on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of the blood cell flood in the total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at the time .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ fi@@ cities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ tre indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture in a series where a micro@@ scopic level of ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown agent compared to the International Standard prepar@@ atory or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be retained for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is appro@@ ve by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is thus closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by means of further drying about phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent State authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfil the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ e or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after replacement , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or visible particles .
the re@@ agents needed for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has been established through a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all returned re@@ agents must be kept from the laboratory so long , until it can be assumed with some probability that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container a black and white printed label is to be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
in addition , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
