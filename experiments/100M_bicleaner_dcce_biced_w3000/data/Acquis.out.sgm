<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States, Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">(GRÜNDE - a) The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>

<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Trade Account" consisting of the funds made by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special action account; this account is referred to as "steward" by the organization, and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transactions account is separately and separately guided by all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The fees are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization's deposit.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two rates (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution of 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments prior to the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">With the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without any benefits; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly-paid development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), irrespective of whether it belongs to the organisation's loan program or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and managed for the funding loans funded by the organization, with the purpose stated under letter b) of the preamble for this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization they retain.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The receipts from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator decided at the time of loan granted, could be beneficiaries of a transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator has informed the EEC as far as the complete abandonment of all transactions is provided by the directors in preparation and through the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan, the administrator maintains the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses paid for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the caretaker notifies the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external auditor of the organisation for this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC is informed as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transactions account.</seg>
