this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) alternating with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased tur@@ mo@@ il or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to take @-@ in or the melt tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients taking other medicines at the same time , which are de@@ composed as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a smaller measure , acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , whereby psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms are reduced and their re @-@ emergence is prevented .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three trials for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased tur@@ mo@@ il over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared more than twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , compared to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased tur@@ mo@@ il , compared with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of the patients by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients receiving A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased tur@@ mo@@ il and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled cken ) , ac@@ ath@@ lete ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , pal@@ pation ( increased s@@ ali@@ vation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturbances ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the whole European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ lip@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ous and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
if symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , it should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dis@@ missed .
therefore , care should be taken with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ ne@@ ese or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events involving patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ dic@@ s , poly@@ gons , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zation .
if one considers the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate rise in Ari@@ lip@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the lack of data security for humans and the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under H@@ ill@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Dis@@ order - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ surgical treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
adverse events related to anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose is of benefit since Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma degradation .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1 receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dal and on the tur@@ f .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medications were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the incidence of recur@@ r@@ ence , which was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l Group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed a plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared with plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed a effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period of 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ ar@@ ction , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average Eli@@ mination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did not show gender @-@ dependent effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients .
a pop @-@ out @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times of middle ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared with plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max average value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control a@@ eti@@ cide and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution and begin with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ v@@ enting adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine for A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melt tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ zophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
research on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ous and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ dic@@ s , poly@@ gons , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to comb@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ative was greater compared with the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15@@ mg dose ) were used as the one @-@ time injection of intra@@ muscul@@ arly and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zation , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zation , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) of intra@@ muscul@@ arly received , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the after every gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ i@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
adverse events related to anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution was compared with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the observed medi@@ an improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar effectiveness has been observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ zophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the incidence of recur@@ r@@ ence , which was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , decreased by at least 7 % against the initial value in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week extension of study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ ar@@ ction , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection the AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 - or 5 times over the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular layers .
in studies of reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application there were no safety @-@ related concerns following mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans ; they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or Par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ calcium carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ kidney @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the medium steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times the middle steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole application or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only those patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer gave no difference to the efficacy indicators such as time before disease wor@@ sen@@ ing and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it should also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils before the treatment begins .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that , in patients with whom the initial treatment no longer suggests , it was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines it is not necessary to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached in degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were conducted and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no renewed abrasion cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increase again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly related kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if patients receive nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm storage prior to the treatment , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic density and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al relationship was established with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active in the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ sis .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ ble network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ f@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ doc@@ etal transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ated receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor area due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ f@@ aded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma over 30 minutes .
this multic@@ entre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for finishing on bas@@ eline owing to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to an extensive ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with the intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a removal was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of over 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ s@@ amed is similar to a biological drug already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ blood values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the intervention and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is to be expected .
treatment with Ab@@ s@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or if they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ s@@ amed was compared with the reference medicinal product in a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before being converted to Ab@@ s@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study that investig@@ ates the effects of fl@@ ot@@ amed fl@@ ot@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were killed on Ab@@ s@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pi@@ erc@@ ing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
fl@@ ot@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
fl@@ ot@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not cause allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed it was proved in accordance with the regulations of the European Union that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ is@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction in the need for trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma receiving chemotherapy and the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical procedures involving a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with which the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
given this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes increased &lt; 4@@ 0.000 cells / µ@@ l against the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained by 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood @-@ preserved foods is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the on@@ set therapy begins .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative procedure and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin at er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a fl@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which do not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA to months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as a reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis value should be determined and the common causes of failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ mag@@ xi@@ mab , infection or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the label value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ yte &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the plat@@ el@@ et and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if there is no other cause of an active loss , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dosage and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , if possible , the cause of an@@ emia should be investigated prior to the on@@ set of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate pro@@ phyla@@ xis since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events like m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral isch@@ a@@ emia , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mbo@@ sis , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tic events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
independent of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease can cause thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ gen@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed a significant significantly higher mortality compared to controls due to various common malign@@ an@@ cies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and at controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved by intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are intended 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies , with approximately the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dosage , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced federal body weight , a delay in the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .

the owner of the risk management plan listed in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , are obliged to carry out the Risk Management Plan pursuant to each subsequent amend@@ ment of the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information that could have an impact on the current safety specifications , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • Mil@@ estones within 60 days of reaching an important ( the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or Risk Re@@ duction )
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in a month before your treatment • If you suffer from an unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a blood c@@ lot has occurred before you

during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is re@@ formed during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated with Ab@@ s@@ amed prior to therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ster@@ one after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will stop your therapy with Ab@@ s@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor can take into consideration an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed up until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of the an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ s@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ s@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of red blood dy@@ es ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past already thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ s@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined before the start of your treatment .
if your values of red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ is@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines / use it or used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ s@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are well adjusted , you get regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equal sized inj@@ ections .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor keeps this for appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .

ac@@ la@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as with stroke ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ cord can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ cord may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ cord is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ cord .
the first study included nearly 8@@ 0,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was examined .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ cord was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % against the initial value .
in the study of older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ cord ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ cord ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ cord had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ up@@ a occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ la@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ la@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ cord is providing clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how the medicine is to be used , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ cord in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra @-@ indications in pregnancy and nursing women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of acet@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ cord should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with Ac@@ cord , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ cord ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ up@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of ac@@ la@@ a can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of ac@@ la@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In Pati@@ ents with a C@@ ret@@ an @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ cord is not recommended , since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with ac@@ la@@ a prior to therapy with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone structure a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ cord ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should undergo a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
no data is available for patients who need dental intervention , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of ac@@ la@@ a can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) in patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ cord ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid has been associated with kidney function disorders that have been associated with a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the C@@ ret@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the appearance of ren@@ al failure and impaired ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ zing and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ car@@ a versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were treated with 2,3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ cord in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ cord in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ cord ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid in a large clinical trial were reported using local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ opor@@ osis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections , including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports are based on cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ing .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ cord and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of over@@ dosage leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ cord 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density evaluation ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing fluid body frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ac@@ la@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk for spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ cord showed an equally lasting effect over three years resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ cord increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the bending radius by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
oste@@ opor@@ osis in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ la@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pool area .
in comparison with plac@@ ebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ cord reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ cord compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the ac@@ la@@ a treatment increased compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at the overall sc@@ ents and legs at all times .
over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the Ac@@ cord treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total hip and 4.3 % at the arm neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in ac@@ la@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of Ac@@ cord was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ cord was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moderate heavy mor@@ bus past@@ ing of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influ@@ encing after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ cord and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients classified as responsive Respon@@ ds at the end of the six @-@ month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with ac@@ la@@ a and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic approach of 141 of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained for an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be a dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long eli@@ oration phase with a terminal eli@@ reduction period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentrations against time ) .
a reduced clearance from cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely to be metaboli@@ zed because it is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min do not require the dosage adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
since severe kidney function ( C@@ ret@@ an Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is only limited , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al @-@ effective intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was administered in rats by applying doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to 7 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common result in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an attack which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum @-@ calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded .

according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current statements on security , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ il@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is structured in an un@@ organized way , making the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ up@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure in order to ensure normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ cord .
if you use Ac@@ cord with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines / use it or used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medications known to them that they damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ cord along with food and drink , you should be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you intake sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ cord .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ cord 2 or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these directions exactly so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ up@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ cord is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termin@@ ating the treatment with Ac@@ cord If you consider stopping the treatment with Ac@@ cord , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ cord .
at the moment it is unclear whether Ac@@ up@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received ac@@ last@@ a .
physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling of the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ate is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ cord , patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid onto bone structure a temporary , sometimes asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500@@ mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ cord .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of Ac@@ cord .

compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( abnormal obesity ) with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more .
in addition , four studies were carried out in over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent in comparing to a plac@@ ebo .
the studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a in this field of application was difficult to assess .
the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it must also not be applied in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , evo@@ ke su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among a small minority of patients .
caution is advised while applying A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for the treatment of HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ ac my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , who furthermore have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ ämie ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive diseases or mood changes with de@@ pressed symptoms were reported up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case prev@@ ails the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also possible for patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any apparent risks , may result in depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other nearby persons may point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular occurrence ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects associated with treatment in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight loss and due to accompanying metabolic diseases .
when the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ates ( for adverse events ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) . NG In evaluating side effects , the following factors are explained :
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0,1 % ) ; very t
only slight symptoms were observed in a toler@@ ability study where a limited number of individuals were administered up to 300 mg .

5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the un@@ desirable effects that were not observed in clinical studies but which were found in animals after exposure to human therapy were considered to be relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress as to dealing with the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects on fertility or cycle disturbances were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diab@@ etic medicine ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest compatible dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ p or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ drug or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered by the dosage of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of additional acet@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % whereas the additional administration of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had lowered the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
acet@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit from Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is poorly regulated with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age is not available , therefore the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
in this study , there was an increase in reports of heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters have been evaluated .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or three @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported with a decrease in visual acuity by a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but ad@@ mitt@@ ent doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological evaluation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or if this occurs , treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the blood insulin sensitivity generated during pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , isolated cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ indications performed more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced breast cancer , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch it was rarely reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with respect to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ isons .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nucle@@ us recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated by the activation of specific nucle@@ us recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the production of glucose in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide was continued over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was poorly regulated despite three months of optimisation with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials for one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes patients with 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gi@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , increasing HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on while values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the ni@@ b@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ ci@@ ally increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both about an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease in groups were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with peak concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it was proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ex@@ erts no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral colon@@ ised pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma eli@@ zation period of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the blood insulin sensitivity generated in the gest@@ ation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones resulted in increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were investigated .
in clinical studies more than 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease compared to the initial values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the ni@@ b@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ ci@@ ally elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both about an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above an@@ kl@@ es , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vit@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medications , there was an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror indicating that the blood sugar levels were similarly lowered as with another human insulin .
acet@@ lo@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ qui@@ ph@@ ane need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar ( see the complete list of packages ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end up with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tually - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally reversible .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ e@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of activity is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on security pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle is removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) must be increased before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ed according to the manual for the first use .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the active ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the procedure of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id doses may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar level .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin which is quickly acting must first be absorbed , followed by the amount of insulin produced .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the meeting place - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) .

clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that an intraven@@ ously given Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.1 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of activity is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0,@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D- glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature when using in@@ fusion bags made of polypropylene .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients already showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , there may still be g@@ out attacks ; therefore it is recommended that patients continue to take further drugs for the prevention of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , where 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems only received 100 m@@ g. a day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were under 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who received Aden@@ ural in a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood , Aden@@ ural was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

if the serum acid level still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily .
for patients with severe kidney function impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( C@@ ret@@ an @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .

cardiovascular diseases For patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ s@@ aber @-@ based medicines , acute toxic@@ ity may occur during the beginning of the treatment because the reduction of serum resin acid can initially mobili@@ se ure@@ a @-@ acid deposits in the tissue .

liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients receiving f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the fe@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure and in the further course of the liver ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was no interaction studies conducted on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 m@@ g. of AD@@ EN@@ IC 1 x measured an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .

50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage return of serum resin acid concentrations in subjects regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of studies ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the Phase 3 extension study collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out node , which resulted in a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out nodes up to 24 % in 54 % of the patients .
elevated TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage drop in serum acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
plasma protein binding from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause when there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and Vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of low vitamin D patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those receiving only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose required for preventing bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia ( abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic b@@ umping .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be applied .
it must not be used in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these guidelines carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not be placed before the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y are given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , g@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out to the occurrence of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ony , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ slu@@ gg@@ ish heart@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the appearance of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after market launch ) , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens predominantly contain bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates administered intraven@@ ously .
there are no data available that indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a lower surgical intervention will reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but will continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately prior to therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was jointly taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was reported .
nevertheless , decreases in serum cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ suffici@@ ency of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ oma , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ mb@@ ones continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was also maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily donation of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15 % ) .

bio@@ availability increased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distri@@ butions of rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after IV dosage of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bone or dischar@@ ged with urine .

following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounts to 71 ml / min and systemic clearance does not exceed 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .

the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) was 12 hours .
the formation of vitamin D3 in the liver is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver and is metaboli@@ zed in the kidney into 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ Vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the case of decay after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is still likely that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ enti@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the gra@@ ft was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ enti@@ f was absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ enti@@ f should not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) medicines are taken together with advance , as the prescribed dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; alterations of the formulation or the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under the close supervision of an experienced physician in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained in systemic exposure .
the dosage of Adv@@ enti@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood mirr@@ oring ( see below )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ enti@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients with both form@@ ulations .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ enti@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clearing substance , an adjustment of the pan can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not allow oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ enti@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ enti@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendations - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ enti@@ f must be converted a transplan@@ t receiver of two daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ enti@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are switched to an advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with an@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal patients , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining the blood level mirr@@ oring in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful observation of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ lays and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ enti@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ enti@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ enti@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the steady state occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the tal@@ low of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; alterations of the formulation or the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under the close supervision of an experienced physician in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which turned out to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ enti@@ f .
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation in advance for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with adv@@ ent ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases under Pro@@ gra@@ f an aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ enti@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as Adv@@ enti@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirror with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was performed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which affect metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone levels , precau@@ tionary measures should be taken especially cau@@ ti@@ ously .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and increase their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of un@@ desirable events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effects of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects listed below are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) .

infection and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As is well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients suffering from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are often increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , including therapy with Adv@@ enti@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus cannot be di@@ aly@@ zed .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated on a molecular level through its binding to a zy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .

175 l@@ ung@@ ed patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the findings in large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In interim analysis of a recent , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported more than 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis of obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection rate was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml per 5 .
the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the dis@@ connected fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a reinforcement of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ enti@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( once daily ) to the total daily dose ( mg : mg ) .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which turned out to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ enti@@ f .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether it is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to form the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II .
advance is similar to a medicinal product approved in the European Union named Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently so that the drug does not contain any protein of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ oc@@ ates in the prevention of ble@@ edings in 86 % of 510 new ble@@ edings by &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of advoc@@ ates ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ates may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of Adv@@ oc@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ aging events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma level ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in response to factor VI@@ II , different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ life periods .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , where the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
furthermore , in none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was established .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ ous gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , an allergic type was reported in A@@ DV@@ ATE , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ des ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X by Factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP still has evaluated the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the filing patent will apply for further extension in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited formally approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has withdrawn its application for the application of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to be able to carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumour and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body is normally used to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not adequately demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways induced by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are c@@ logged .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main effect was the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiovascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit from SP Europe for the marketing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms decay .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease over time in the case of long @-@ term application .
after swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of the end of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be performed per@@ ally or nas@@ ally ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce corresponding recommendations for dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ols have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be dis@@ missed .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to skin reactions indicators .
in the context of clinical trials involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vivo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ ol during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies yiel@@ ded no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic density or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mol@@ or , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ al processes .
headache , anxiety , sc@@ ary Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , prec@@ eal pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary freeze and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ so@@ hil@@ es and inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause more sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 years of age with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ ist efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient sub@@ sets defined by gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the yield balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was achieved on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio @-@ equivalent was for exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n reveal no particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drinking or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of the medicine called pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ ov@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer leading to nar@@ rowing the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the es@@ oph@@ agus ) , a closure of the stomach outlet or the du@@ oden@@ um ( col@@ on closure ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the medical history ( short@@ ness of the lungs ) , prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys , or bladder .
tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosed with the following symptoms or diseases using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High @-@ blood pressure • Heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations • ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and headache , or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
transport and operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage , it is not possible to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should immediately inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in good time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ pation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disturbances , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reported very rarely about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver assets was also very rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ ting .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by investigating the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ le , sleep and efficiency of the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented in order to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in the case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit from SP Europe for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of deser@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been termin@@ ated and resum@@ ed after the symptoms are resum@@ ed .
in the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient may be recommended during the allergy time an ongoing treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic density or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry conditions ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ so@@ hil@@ es and inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
as hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ary diseases , it is expected that , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in vivo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on security pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n reveal no particular dangers to humans .
coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ellose , Titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ kar@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ellose , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax .
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ap@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher endurance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metaboli@@ zed is identical to that of children who are healthy .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with ap@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine treatments , received a daily dosis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not interfere with the psych@@ om@@ otor system .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous use of alcohol was neither to increase alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as was shown on the basis of the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively l@@ essen the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ max levels of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ in@@ glass bottles with child safe polypropylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of ap@@ eri@@ us ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate once a day lay in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate must be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting pills each day put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of deser@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of side effects between the loss and plac@@ ebo arm was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the inclusion of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( A@@ w@@ ak@@ ening 2 % , children 3 % ) , however the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ finding studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for acceptance , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical trials for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation represents an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical applications .
the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that is fully metaboli@@ zed is identical to that of children who are healthy .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo reported diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms and
as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively l@@ essen the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ max levels of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia , frequent side effects while in adults fatigue , dry mouth and head@@ aches were often reported as plac@@ ebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for insertion is available in bottles with child safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe for adding with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml t@@ ins .
in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s in@@ tranet to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to form fast antibodies when it comes to contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was cleaned up with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this did not extend the clinical data base to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swal@@ low the capsules , it is ad@@ mitt@@ edly available as a solution to use , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ acy should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ meth@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ meth@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
aids cannot be cured , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby the development of infected infections and diseases .
A@@ meth@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the A@@ meth@@ ase , which was enhanced with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not previously taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks in general , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ meth@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ meth@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the A@@ meth@@ ase drug used to treat viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment was as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ meth@@ ase , together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger drop in viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ meth@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash , and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ chi@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ meth@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals that are degra@@ ded just like ap@@ her@@ ase and are det@@ ri@@ mental to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs , the benefits of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children were out@@ weigh@@ ed over four years against the risks .
A@@ meth@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ acy in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ meth@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of A@@ gro@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ meth@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children aged 4 and older .
usually , A@@ meth@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre @-@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ meth@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
2 If A@@ gro@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ meth@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ meth@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ meth@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver dys@@ functions , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
it may not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present the substrate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ meth@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ por@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ meth@@ ase capsules must be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing &apos;s Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin are strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ap@@ portion@@ ate with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , am@@ at@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ tom@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on om@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ on content of the as@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with caution against certain other patient populations .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases to which medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ts , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ha@@ iled patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ po@@ ids are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medium with a low therapeutic width of A@@ meth@@ ase may not simultaneously be used with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present the substrate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ meth@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by adding other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have been observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already receives St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ sprinkl@@ ing levels and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was given .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma obtained at the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are about 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is unknown .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed in combination with di@@ an@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ di component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ tom@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine possibly lowers the serum concentration of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r .
should these drugs be used at the same time , caution is advised , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution must be advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ tom@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , thereby increasing the side @-@ effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ meth@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) at 2.@@ 69@@ fold in comparison to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including medi@@ ums , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions when used together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as ap@@ her@@ ase as it can result in absorption problems .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ den@@ pin , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous use with as@@ gener@@ ase may increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ meth@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as ad@@ minist@@ ase .
since plasma concentrations of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for this reason , as@@ gener@@ acy should not be applied together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on om@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , such as the Am@@ pren@@ atal dose , if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended for the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as ad@@ minist@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ pers@@ avi@@ r from des@@ ol@@ ation to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side @-@ effects associated with the A@@ chi@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , appeared early and rarely led to treatment interruption .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ meth@@ ase or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ meth@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cr@@ ative fat accumulation .
only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean duration of 36 weeks .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients were found in Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin erup@@ tions were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ af nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ meth@@ ase twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception was increases of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d and CP@@ K values obtained in patients who received as@@ gener@@ acy together with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ esters with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
in the case of sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pers@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions on the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to alterations by additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
analyses based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pers@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates .
companies developing diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret test results .
each of these four genetic samples associated with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r produces a certain resistance to k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally maintained .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ rel@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
evidence of the efficacy of A@@ meth@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ FIB@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study in which with PI pre@@ treated adults treated with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ o@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the Part Study A of PRO@@ FIB@@ 17 .
the primary analysis was the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ cap@@ illary wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ acy is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ meth@@ ase was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gro@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) versus the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ chi@@ ase should be taken into consideration when optimizing therapy with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the medium duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pere avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pere @-@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
for this reason , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time using as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ meth@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily pren@@ atal exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ances of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r twice daily without con@@ current administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were used in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance for these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel tests on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes were neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical studies , neither during ad@@ minist@@ ering nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality both in the control and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ meth@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ meth@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ meth@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with low or minor liver dys@@ functions , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
aspir@@ ation should be set to 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma obtained at the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are about 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is unknown .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution must be advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ tom@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dosage 31 , although no clinical data is available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ den@@ pin , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended for the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ pers@@ avi@@ r from des@@ ol@@ ation to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ acy should be taken into consideration when optimizing therapy with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time using as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ances of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were used in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice a daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance for these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel tests on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality both in the control and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in young the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully developed , so Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) previously treated adults and children aged 4 and older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ meth@@ ase solution for taking into consideration was not occupied with previously untreated patients or with PI previously treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to take @-@ in ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gro@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ meth@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with ren@@ al failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ meth@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ por@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
aspir@@ ation should be stopped in the long run if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ha@@ iled patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ po@@ ids are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ sprinkl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was given .
simultaneous consumption with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data from 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral application of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . a gener@@ alized solution for taking into account may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl alcohol contained in the pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ pers@@ avi@@ r from des@@ ol@@ ation to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ meth@@ ase or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
early abor@@ tion of 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ acy should be taken into consideration when optimizing therapy with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large ve@@ al volume as well as un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of low bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream has to be added three times a week for six weeks . • In case of low bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ y to apply to the affected areas of the skin , so that it stays on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four major studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ tic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p with immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine is continued until all the visible ni@@ p@@ ples have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons were completely healed after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in a thin layer and apply in the clean@@ sed , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .

it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies in which no daily allow@@ ance was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with a stro@@ kes leading to circumcision were observed .
an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream directly following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous uses for the treatment of external cow@@ ards in the genital and per@@ ic@@ al@@ escent sphere , no clinical experience has been found so far .
although limited data indicate an increased rate of cow@@ ards reduction in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ards .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or reactions after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cr@@ ème .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days can be made .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data is available for the treatment of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use in previously treated tum@@ ours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose , or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after once nor after repeated topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be made to use during breast@@ feeding .
the most common adverse events and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the site of treating the cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most frequently reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in connection with side effects include complaints at the application ort with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side @-@ effects listed below .
the most common adverse effect , possibly or possibly associated with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , was a response in these studies ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects listed in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme @-@ treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ tion / sc@@ rolling ( 23 % ) and o@@ est@@ rogen ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and carb@@ oni@@ zation ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical studies investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ent oral absorption of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized itself to oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards with an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of patients who had been treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the cow@@ ards were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo who had been treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
full healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ours were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial BC@@ Cs with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical consec@@ ration after one or two treatment periods .
in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , the permitted indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial cell@@ ulose carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic up@@ take of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week use during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able p@@ ou@@ ch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours in the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for people to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ours performed in the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

if your skin respon@@ ds too much to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a degra@@ ded number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause a blue stain to occur more quickly or it can cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
in addition , you may feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of the patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions , which will disappear within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the application place ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , Hau@@ tz@@ brin@@ oly@@ tis , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .

this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and therefore accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reactions .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years old , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60 % and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever , and reactions on the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring magnitude of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will check every year all new information that may be known , and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ als cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which rein@@ vigor@@ ation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase III study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in resum@@ ing treatment after a longer break , it is necessary to carefully proceed with the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are brought to a drop , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
as there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk compared to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and in 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

in most patients it came to a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a severe delay in patients under 5 years of age ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days with patients at age 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients showed no anti @-@ radio@@ immun@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ tic ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it never came to a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ des a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enz@@ ym@@ atic replacement therapy lies in a sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation .
after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and is absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study involving the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients in the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the difficult phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected feed and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for a further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and vi@@ ability in the plac@@ ebo group shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ atine ) was detected , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in view of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients that was taken into account by using a combined end point ( expected percentage normal Fe@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe delay and 4 with the average oral form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with severe delay ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients with severe progression could only have limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 e / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .

this tab will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ ion id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medications containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
application Advice - di@@ lution and application The concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for IV application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditioned involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , air@@ still@@ ness and facial oil .
very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nausea • abdominal pain • Joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , first determine the number of penet@@ rates to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( anti @-@ cancer medication ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , dis@@ continued or the dose be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural light , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed an average of 12.@@ 1 month compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival compared to the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
every screw @-@ through has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of the sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see paragraph 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Gift as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ et , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te en@@ umer@@ ation .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapeutic cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if there is a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 or so@@ - fort he incidence of 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or older than 65 years of age there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adjustments that go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et number again has a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ bi@@ ased if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous taking of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in the trans@@ cellular space should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were sometimes reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible ble@@ aching of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment tin to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed expul@@ sion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advised if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds are available with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in case of an application during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , unless absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to consult with regard to the sperm storage .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 163 people with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who random@@ ly received c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Level 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 in the summari@@ zed results of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mono@@ therapies , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences can probably be trac@@ ed back to differences in the patient population , since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of the liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC , random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 8@@ 30 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal transit , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis , and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) .
clinical studies were occasionally reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ co@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by Thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ous patients with a mal@@ ig@@ thin ple@@ ural com@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically significant survival compared to those patients who were only inj@@ ected with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the trial medication in the arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural muscle was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy had medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ dis@@ kl@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.0 months , adapted HR = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
medi@@ an PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in line with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats which are fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients .
in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took all@@ i 60 mg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair clo@@ ister , fa@@ sion , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily stool , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ yp@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ bed , the elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not need adjustment of the dosage .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Cholest@@ asis • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Premature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic check , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dose of the anti@@ diab@@ etic must be adapted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers receiving or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† Es is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight individuals without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be trac@@ ed back to the lip@@ ase inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ bic hair passages .
from clinical studies it was estimated that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ yp@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight versus the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of studies ( Table 1 ) and as a share of those participating in study , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist circum@@ ference was about 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral dosage of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be detected only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation .
in a study involving obes@@ e patients with minimal systemic stress , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ mol@@ yl leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified , representing nearly 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on security pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the owner of the authorisation for placing on the market must ensure that the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System , described in the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks following treatment , since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may consume each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial night@@ stand as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms appear , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep the medicine in@@ accessible for children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box . • Do not store above 25 ° C . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les that you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume each day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the quantity of calories that is appropriate for you can be found in the information below which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Due to the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended intake of fat , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually lose weight .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; tann@@ ing physical activity &quot; means that you do not go up daily , work up stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 calories per day , for example through 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calcium and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal with information on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ ori@@ - and fat @-@ du@@ cks and give guidelines to become physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the pot@@ ency of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ medicine ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
al@@ oh@@ xi was examined in three major studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission informed the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancers and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty Ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics studied against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ abine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , re@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery site ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of un@@ desirable events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , but due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life sentence of 7.@@ 3 hours ) given in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , given intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of studies with medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular deport@@ ation and repression and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the goal of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of the intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption Accor@@ ding to IV dosage , an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to the IV dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations , the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached at once daily intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the intake of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ances 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver dys@@ functions increase the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use .
10 . prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and prolon@@ ging the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and as Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .
the holder of this authorisation for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission of the plans for the placing of the drug approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report , in which the approval of the authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal properties that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon has been compared to the efficacy of the reference physician to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int .
furthermore , concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical studies .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed up again in more patients than in the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug detects an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ o@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used for patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age the skin area to be treated must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was termin@@ ated at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under the age of Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough for the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the surface of the surface .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infections , the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on de@@ ported skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle retin@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % on the sk@@ id skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity following oral intake and are insufficient regarding a statement on the effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin balance should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , it is necessary to consider the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefits of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which have used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the date of delivery about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding at this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , a consultation with experts should be sought .
no differences were found in the in vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied on a daily basis under oc@@ clu@@ sion and applied to the skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 weakened skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism of the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies of the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there was neither male nor female signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an exposure reached up to 5 times was reached as the highest appreciated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 weakened skin :

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ tions are applied as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
therefore , ambi@@ tions may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can end .
if a refres@@ her dosage is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ ence or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vaccine EL@@ rix Children permitted since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , however , in the context of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses , Twin@@ lock adults and twin I@@ rix Children are administered .
because Ambi@@ ence and Twin@@ lock adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data which support the application of Twin@@ lock adults were also used as a proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) include headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ iness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission informed the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for placing Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ) are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have referred to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a booster as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
after the pri@@ ming of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ operative injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success in the glut@@ eal muscles , these injection paths should be avoided .
however , in cases of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ ence can be inj@@ ected by sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ ence was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ on @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ter@@ ity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ ers and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were given to a total of 10@@ 27 in@@ oc@@ ulations between 1 and 15 years of age .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a basis for calculation per vaccine Ambi@@ ence , but not on a basis for calculation per person .
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix with 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects according to the dose of a 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects received Ambi@@ ence reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ ence was comparable to that of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who got Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of pronounced pain and fatigue was small and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose @-@ administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose @-@ administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ ence and 147 were awarded the standard combin@@ ation@@ sim@@ mer@@ ing vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month of 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immun@@ ological responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination pattern .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ atic A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ - and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to investigate possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes both before and after the conclusion of the resin .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , amended version shall be carried out by a state laboratory or laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through food and beverages that contain viruses , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require hosp@@ ital@@ isation .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although you / your child may not feel ill or ill at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the normally planned administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA Units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / its body &apos;s def@@ enses , or if you / your child undergo a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ tions can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medications ( including those that you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child was recently vacc@@ inated / has received / has received immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) / has or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ ence should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , ambition is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • pain or discomfort on the punc@@ ture or redness • Mat@@ ter@@ ity • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 de@@ formed cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B very rarely ( less than 1 case per 10,000 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) are :
these include loc@@ alized or extended erup@@ tions that may itch or ves@@ ic@@ le , swelling of the eye contours and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child is considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this package .
ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data known as the first authorization for placing on the market , CH@@ MP felt that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ence remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ ica can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose secre@@ tion ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ ica could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a fake medicine , that is , without active substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ ica can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , loss of taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ica was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease , only limited information about this drug was available at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for babies , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthesis or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets cannot be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a is a risk when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) of sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and e@@ dem@@ a .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl concentrate on the liver and kidneys are carried out , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients at least an adverse event ( AE ) occurred and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity with an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is initiated at an early stage and treatment is immediately started in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
through ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ rous oxide , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born infants in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are rarely reversible during treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is secre@@ ted with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
after different dos@@ ages of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after ni@@ gh@@ tly fast no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate was detected in the plasma .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl concentrate with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans did not have any carcin@@ ogen@@ ic effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ intestinal chim@@ e or nose secre@@ tion .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthesis or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ pipes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , l@@ esi@@ ons in the brain @-@ cows of the brain @-@ cows came to l@@ esi@@ ons .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are rarely reversible during treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon is 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication by a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are conducted with you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may enter the breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disorders , de@@ priv@@ ation of ear , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , uncomfortable redness , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date stated on the box and the container by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Use up to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly over the same single doses or take a stri@@ c ( hose that runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose secre@@ tion ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
• Take from the container a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate . • Stret@@ ch a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with the use of a Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent the closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without administration of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other ingredients .
it must also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attacks .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended starting dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous stan@@ ti@@ on of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical necessity .
immediately before the procedure , a yield of 0,5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bolt offering from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the patient dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with no dose adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after finishing the IV dose of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible ble@@ inner disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of the hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occur in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ date , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can generally occur during the treatment .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with a bi@@ vali@@ ant , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters are checked regularly in any case .
the experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ dated alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the ben@@ evol@@ ent group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ edings have been defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ edings as defined in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , reducing the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 4 g / dl with well known bleeding area , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on the data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ dated in 6000 patients who have under@@ gone a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ categories in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with the patient is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ ine inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dated to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ dated patients had no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently carried out in the patients , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ dated should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
arm A and B patients were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ dated were evaluated in patients who underwent a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din as pep@@ tide passes a cat@@ aboli@@ sm into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 @-@ binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin lou@@ sin is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active life than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot operate insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin embr@@ yos .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amounted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra , compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine or any other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously into the area of the abdominal sac@@ s by continuous in@@ fusion .
due to the reduced glucose availability and the reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function .
every change of the effective strength , the brand ( producers ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these states are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , vap@@ ori@@ de ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic medicines such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ vation the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ es can be atten@@ u@@ ated or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin action occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
listed in clinical studies are listed according to system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on available data not estim@@ able ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is neglected to continually change the injection area within the injection range , may result in a light pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a suit@@ ably trained person or treated by a doctor through intraven@@ ous administration of glucose .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin action the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - , insulin lu@@ lip@@ sin showed a dose proportional glu@@ cos@@ yl@@ ating effect from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg and a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lou@@ sin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ yl@@ ating effect about 2 hours earlier as a human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that during an application of insulin lu@@ lip@@ sin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with a human@@ oid normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ c@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with a human normal insulin inj@@ ected 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ c@@ sin is turned on 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to a normal insulin analog , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin Sul@@ li@@ s@@ ine administered 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ in@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
