<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you require further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternating with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased turmoil or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to take-in or the melt tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients taking other medicines at the same time, which are decomposed as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole is believed to be" "" "partial agony" "" "for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a smaller measure, acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripianzol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, whereby psychotic or manic symptoms are reduced and their re-emergence is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three trials for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased turmoil over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared more than twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased turmoil, compared with the Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of the patients by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients receiving Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased turmoil and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled cken), acathlete (drowsiness), vomiting (drowsiness), vomiting (drowsiness), vomiting (diarrhea), palpation (increased salivation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar-I, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and their manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy, the Arilipprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerious and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripianzol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, care should be taken with caution in patients with seizures in the anamneese or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripianzol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response for undesired cerebrovascular events involving patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydics, polygons, polyphagony and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripianzol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolization, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolization.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate rise in Arilipprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the lack of data security for humans and the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripianzol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia occurred compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripianzol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripianzol was 15.1% in patients under Hillapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-Disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Ariiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-surgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripianzol treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Ariiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripianzol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripianzol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to anti-psychotic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Aripianzol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose zures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintended or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a haemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that haemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose is of benefit since Aripianzol has a high plasma degradation.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripianzol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine levels and serotonin 5HTA receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripianzol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HTA and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudal and on the turf.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripianzol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients receiving a response to study medications were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripianzol showed a significantly higher decline in the incidence of recurrence, which was found at 34% in the Aripianzol Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% versus the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder Aripianzol showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripianzol showed a effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazl showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripianzol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period of 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed superior to the prevention of a bipolar rearction, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylosis of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl on extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripianzol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did not show gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-out-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripianzol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data had no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependant adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times of middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the metabolites of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of hydroxy- Aripiprazole found in the human gall found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11-fold the middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripianzol injection solution and begin with oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine for Abilify tablets, Abilify melt tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the effectiveness of Aripianzol injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders that were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripianzol injection solution, patients should be observed regarding extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Research on the safety and efficacy of Aripianzol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerious and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during the treatment with Aripianzol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydics, polygons, polyphagony and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comborbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedative was greater compared with the single dose of Aripianzol, in a study in which healthy subjects Aripiprazole (15mg dose) were used as the one-time injection of intramuscularly and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripianzol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolization, compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolization, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- Proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) of intramuscularly received, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared with the after every gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripianzol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Ariiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Ariiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Ariiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripianzol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripianzol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to anti-psychotic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Aripianzol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose zures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders, the Aripianzol injection solution was compared with statistically significant greater improvements of aggregation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripianzol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of aggregation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed median improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar effectiveness has been observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients receiving a response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripianzol (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the incidence of recurrence, which was found at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective 'weight gain' was, decreased by at least 7% against the initial value in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripianzol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week extension of study in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed superior to the prevention of a bipolar rearction, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection the AUC is 90% larger the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripianzol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 - or 5 times over the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg intra-muscular layers.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies of reproductive toxicity following IV application there were no safety-related concerns following maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripianzol (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data had no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans; they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-Accumulation and / or Parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose for humans) and an increase of adrenal-calcium carcinomas and combined adrenal-kidney-adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the metabolites of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the medium steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters previously had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole application or as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment of 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only those patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer gave no difference to the efficacy indicators such as time before disease worsening and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should also not be used in patients who are breastfeeding or have low neutrophils before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) stated that, in patients with whom the initial treatment no longer suggests, it was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other Paclitaxel medicines it is not necessary to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the marketing of Abraxane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma in patients with first-line metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane-therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In case of sensory neuropathy degree 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached in degrees 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired renal function were conducted and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have much other pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed abrasion cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils increase again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly related kardiotoxicity was not proven, cardiac outages in the indicated patient population are not uncommon, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If patients receive nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constitive methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied in pregnant women or in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, unless the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane will be advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm storage prior to the treatment, as the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very frequent) and dizziness (frequent), which can affect the traffic density and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactic hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagie, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, neck pain, inguinal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, back pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal relationship was established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a microtubules active in the microtubules from the tubulae and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolysis.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtuble network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transfytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendocetal transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminated receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor area due to the albumin protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unfaded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III trial study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for finishing on baseline owing to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The drug exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration increased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to an extensive extravascular distribution and / or binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with the intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urea removal was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of over 75, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that Absamed is similar to a biological drug already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called" "" "reference medicinal" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-blood values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood donor is not possible before the intervention and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Absamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor if they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietinsufficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, Absamed was compared with the reference medicinal product in a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a vein before being converted to Absamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study that investigates the effects of flotamed flotamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were killed on Absamed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Flotamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Flotamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not cause allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed it was proved in accordance with the regulations of the European Union that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abisamed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the marketing of Abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction in the need for transfusion in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma receiving chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in case of planned larger surgical procedures involving a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml that cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients with which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in the haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hemoglobin target concentrations of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of anemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hemoglobin target concentrations of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulosis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of Reticulozytes increased &lt; 40.000 cells / µl against the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of the haemoglobin value increased ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulosis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained by 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulosis by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood-preserved foods is required, should receive Abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the onset therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the operative procedure and on the day of the intervention (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of the dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with any erythropoetin at erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a flamed or other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and which do not participate in an autologous blood donor program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA to months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as a reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased demand for transfusions, the reticulosis value should be determined and the common causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminimagximab, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the label value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Reticulocyte "Index"), is lower (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the platelet and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if there is no other cause of an active loss, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits attributed to the administration of epoetins if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present knowledge, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-dosage and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, the cause of anemia should be investigated prior to the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic procedure should receive appropriate prophylaxis since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events like myocardial ischemia, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, retinalthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombocytic events (see Section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetins.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; it examined the number of fractures over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In Morbus Paget, Accord was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% against the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study of older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Accord (without other osteoporosis treatment) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Accord (with or without other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Accord had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Acupa occur within the first three days of infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclaa may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronc acid or other bisphosphonates or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclaa are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Accord is providing clarification material for doctors who prescribe aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications of how the medicine is to be used, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted the company Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the placing of Accord in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contra-indications in pregnancy and nursing women • Required of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclaa is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of acetlasta infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget Morbus, Accord should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Paget Morbus with Accord, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Accord (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. oralem or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Acupa infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of aclaa can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) In Patients with a Cretan-in-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Accord is not recommended, since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary, since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data on safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is treated with aclaa prior to therapy with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Zoledronlic acid on bone structure a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Accord (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should undergo a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry before applying bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who need dental intervention, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of aclaa can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) in patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Accord (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function Zoledronlic acid has been associated with kidney function disorders that have been associated with a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Cretatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the appearance of renal failure and impaired renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclazing and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Accara versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were treated with 2,3% of patients treated with Accord in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Accord in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Accord (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of Zoledronlic acid in a large clinical trial were reported using local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoporosis in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteoporosis (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections, including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports are based on cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervening.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Accord and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosage leading to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Accord 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density evaluation (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing fluid body fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures aclaa decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclaa-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk for spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Accord showed an equally lasting effect over three years resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk for hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Accord increased bone density on the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the bending radius by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Osteoporosis in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclaa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pool area.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison with placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Accord reduced BSAP significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to the initial value and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Accord compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the aclaa treatment increased compared to placebo treatment the BMD at the overall scents and legs at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">Over 24 months compared to placebo treatment, the Accord treatment led to an increase of the BMD by 5.4% at the total hip and 4.3% at the arm neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in aclaa-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308) the once annual administration of Accord was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrate BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Accord was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderate heavy morbus pasting of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg zoledronc acid compared to taking 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influencing after 6 months compared to the baseline for Accord and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients classified as responsive Responds at the end of the six-month trial could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with aclaa and 107 patients treated with Risedronate, the therapeutic approach of 141 of patients treated with aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate, could be maintained for an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledronc acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be a dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elioration phase with a terminal elireduction period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent rapid resorption into the bones and excretion through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Zoledron-acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentrations against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance from cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely to be metabolized because it is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-clearing, and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">The result is that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal impairment up to a creatinine clearing up to 35 ml / min do not require the dosage adjustment of the zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney function (Cretan Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is only limited, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal-effective intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC are 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid was administered in rats by applying doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to 7 times the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated exposures, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common result in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysical of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dosages, an attack which reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, one observed a teratogeneity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronlic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bisphosphonates, and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too quickly, and new bone material is structured in an unorganized way, making the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Acupa works by normalizing the bone structure in order to ensure normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not shown. • It can be used together with another diabetes drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest compatible dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resp or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonydrug or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acettos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered by the dosage of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of additional acettos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea in a reduction of HbA1c values was 0.94% whereas the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had lowered the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acettos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, or in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit from Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the marketing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, domed and carry the marking" "" "15" "" "on one side and the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is poorly regulated with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age is not available, therefore the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, there was an increase in reports of heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be continued until the laboratory parameters have been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.1% and insulin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral two-fold or three-fold combination therapy with insulin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with thiazoldindiones, including Pioglitazone, was reported with a decrease in visual acuity by a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but admittent doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or if this occurs, treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the blood insulin sensitivity generated during pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, isolated cases: unknown (not estimable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone ALT-indications performed more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced breast cancer, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo if Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it was rarely reported about heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events with respect to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nucleus receptors (PPAR-γ) activated by the activation of specific nucleus receptors (PPAR-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the production of glucose in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazide was continued over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was poorly regulated despite three months of optimisation with insulin, were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients receiving only insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials for one year, under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decrease compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes patients with 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in the overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or giliclazide, increasing HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon while values decreased under metformin and gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the nibber triglycerides, but also improved the postprancially increased triglyceride levels, both about an effect on triglyceride concentrations and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease in groups were randomised to receive either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with peak concentrations of unmodified Pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it was proven that Pioglitazone exerts no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral colonised pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elization period of unmodified Pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearing of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the blood insulin sensitivity generated in the gestation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldindiones resulted in increased frequency of colonic tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year under Pioglitazone a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decrease compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the nibber triglycerides, but also improved the postprancially elevated triglyceride levels, both about an effect on the triglycerid absorption as well as on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above ankles, coronary revascularisation and revitcularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and in the fracture intervention study (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In phase III studies the mean ascents of the BMD with alendronate amounted to 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at the femur and 7.8% at the Trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a reduction of 48% (alendronate 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of spine and trombones continued; the BMD of the femur and the whole body was also maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">It consisted of two placebo-controlled trials, where Alendronate was taken daily (5 mg. daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily donation of Alendronat reduced the occurrence of at least one new eddy fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15%).</seg>

<seg id="1325">Bioavailability increased to about 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronat was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">Alendronate was effective in osteoporosis studies if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day for five days) led to no clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>

<seg id="1329">Excretion According to intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronat, about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity has been found in the rotting process.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate amounts to 71 ml / min and systemic clearance does not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronate is not excreted by the kidneys via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other drugs by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1402">As tacrolimus and prograf / prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the graft was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a recovery of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Adventif was absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or any of the other ingredients, Adventif should not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and physicians must be cautious when others (in particular some herbal) medicines are taken together with advance, as the prescribed dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; alterations of the formulation or the régime should only be carried out under the close supervision of an experienced physician in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that tacrolimus is maintained in systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Adventif should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood mirroring (see below)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Adventif, the tacrolimus tallow should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients with both formulations.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adventif to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-clearing substance, an adjustment of the pan can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not allow oral intake of drugs, the Tacrolimus treatment can be initiated intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">The duration of the application To suppress the graft rejection must be maintained by immunosuppression; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Adventif therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Adventif therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendations - switch from Prograf to Adventif must be converted a transplant receiver of two daily doses of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Prograf (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to Adventif once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation For adult patients who are switched to an advance, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with anagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal patients, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining the blood level mirroring in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful observation of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatinine levels, a calculation of the creatine inlays and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Adventif When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases by means of full blood tacrolimus-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus tallow during the first two weeks following transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow of tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Adventif, dosage adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could change the tacrolimus blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Adventif is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the steady state occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the tallow of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplants are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects caused by tacrolimus sub- or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; alterations of the formulation or the régime should only be carried out under the close supervision of an experienced physician in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which turned out to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Adventif.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are no clinical data for the retarded formulation in advance for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with advent (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful observation of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered as the tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases under Prograf an aqueous or septum hypertrophy known as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore occur under Adventif.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, show symptoms for PRES like headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">As Adventif hard capsules, retarded, lactose contain, special caution is required in patients with rare hereditary Galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose-malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood mirror with simultaneous dispensing of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was performed with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and voriconazole, as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 which affect metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone levels, precautionary measures should be taken especially cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and increase their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies in transplant patients have no indication that under Tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of undesirable events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tacrolimus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus cannot be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effect of tacrolimus can be mediated on a molecular level through its binding to a zytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 lunged patients, with 475 patients undergoing a pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant, were used as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies was consistent with the findings in large studies where prograf was used in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In interim analysis of a recent, multicentre study with oral prograf was reported more than 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, the bronchiolitis of obliterans- syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus it occurred in 21.7% of cases for the development of a bronchiolitis obliterans in comparison to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection rate was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung-transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the birth of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicentre study with oral prograf was carried out in 205 patients who underwent a pancreas and kidney transplant following a randomised procedure tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of sebum from 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after intestinal transplants showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the disconnected fraction of tacrolimus, or a reinforcement of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This indicates that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly done via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Adventif was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients who were converted from Prograf (once daily) to the total daily dose (mg: mg).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether it is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of hemorrhages in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to form the human clotting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advance is similar to a medicinal product approved in the European Union named Recombinate, but it is made differently so that the drug does not contain any protein of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate Hämophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of Advocates in the prevention of bleedings in 86% of 510 new bleedings by "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advocates (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the placing of Advocates throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution treatment depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhaging events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma level (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-life periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII immunoglobulins which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, where the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of which were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-mirror occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- Spiegel in plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate Hämophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">Furthermore, in none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate Hämophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor was established.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were reported on the occurrence of urticaria, preitus, rash and increased number of eosinophilous granulocytes in several repeated product expositions in the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, an allergic type was reported in ADVATE, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoides (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated Factor VIII acts as a Cofaktor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated Factor X by Factor X.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP still has evaluated the benefit-risk assessment as positive but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited formally approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company has withdrawn its application for the application of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to be able to carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumour and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene in the human body is normally used to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial documents submitted, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not adequately demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways induced by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents aged 12 and older, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clogged.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect was the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was examined, the patients under aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving desolatadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, pseudoephedrine, or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiovascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (cerebral haemorrhagic stroke) or have a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit from SP Europe for the marketing of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms decay.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease over time in the case of long-term application.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydrogotamine or other deongestiva, which can be performed perally or nasally (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pronounce corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerosols have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction, and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headaches) must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests as antihistamines otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to skin reactions indicators.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials involving Desloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentrations of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotoric test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not Desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosol during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies yielded no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to an impairment of traffic density or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremolor, convulsions) with possible letteral processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, scary Miktion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, preceal pain, dizziness, tinnitus, visual disturbances and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary freeze and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / bassohiles and inhibiting the expression of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause more sympathetic effects such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonist efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than monotherapy with pseudoephedrine on the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient subsets defined by gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the yield balance of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was achieved on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects of Desloratadin were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole application of pseudoephedrine bio-equivalent was for exposure after administration of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadin reveal no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin was reported very rarely about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart hunting, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver assets was also very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution for inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by investigating the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrile, sleep and efficiency of the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented in order to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In the case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit from SP Europe for the marketing of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of deseratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and may be terminated after the symptoms have been terminated and resumed after the symptoms are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), the patient may be recommended during the allergy time an ongoing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to an impairment of traffic density or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry conditions (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of the patients treated with Desloratadin and in 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / bassohiles and inhibiting the expression of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving the symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis, as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic Urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria because the underlying pathophysiology, despite the etiology, is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine is a causative factor in all urticary diseases, it is expected that, apart from chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of preitus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic Urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improved itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study involving Desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin reveal no particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with aperius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize Desloratadin and experience a higher endurance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metabolized is identical to that of children who are healthy.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltatic insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup Group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more adverse events in patients with aperius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years of age, who were eligible for antihistamine treatments, received a daily dosis of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not interfere with the psychomotor system.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies of adults, the simultaneous use of alcohol was neither to increase alcohol-induced loss of performance nor to increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving the symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As was shown on the basis of the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively lessen the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of preitus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasia (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis that are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active substance accumulation once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, AUC and Cmax levels of Desloratadin in paediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received Desloratadin syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1793">Immediately before use, the blister must be carefully opened and the dose of the lyophilisate must be removed without damaging it.</seg>
<seg id="1794">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally applied (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1795">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1796">In a multi-dose study, where up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were applied, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In two single dose studies, Aerius Lyophilia was well tolerated; this was documented by clinical laboratory results, medical examinations, vital signs and ECG interval data.</seg>
<seg id="1798">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1799">In a clinical pharmacological study in which Desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1800">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1801">In a 17 single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1802">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving the symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis, as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis.</seg>
<seg id="1804">18 In a pharmacokinetic study in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1809">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of deseratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1)</seg>
<seg id="1810">Immediately before use, the blister must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet is removed without damaging it.</seg>
<seg id="1811">The efficacy and harmlessness of Aerius 2.5 mg of processed tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven until now.</seg>
<seg id="1812">The overall frequency of side effects between the loss and placebo arm was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, Aerius melting tablet proved to be a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for the inclusion of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1814">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically significant</seg>
<seg id="1815">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight track including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this poorly metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adult (6%) and pediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and among blacks (adults 18%, children 16%) greater than in Caucasia (Awakening 2%, children 3%), however the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">In single dose crossover studies of Aerius melting tablet with Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for intake, the formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aerius 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pediatric patients, but in combination with dose-finding studies in children, pharmacokinetic data for Aerius melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="1819">Food has no significant influence on AUC and Cmax of Aerius Aerius Lyophilisate, while food Tmax is extended from 2.5 to 4 hours and Tmax of 3-OH- Desloratadin from 4 to 6 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1828">In single dose crossover studies of Aerius 5 mg fusion tablet with Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for acceptance, the formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>
<seg id="1829">The overall analysis of preclinical and clinical trials for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation represents an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical applications.</seg>
<seg id="1830">The safety of Desloratadin in children between 2 and 11 years that is fully metabolized is identical to that of children who are healthy.</seg>
<seg id="1831">This drug contains sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1832">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1833">In infants aged 6 to 23 months, the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo reported diarrhoea (3.7%), fever (2,3%) and sleeplessness (2,3%).</seg>
<seg id="1834">In an additional study, at a one-time dose of 2.5 mg of Desloratadin solution, no side effects were observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11.</seg>
<seg id="1835">The recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Desloratadin (see section 5.2) in the children's and adult population.</seg>
<seg id="1836">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1837">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively also be in intermittent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms and</seg>
<seg id="1838">As demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively lessen the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for approval of Aflunov's intranet to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have not yet established immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to form fast antibodies when it comes to contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus was cleaned up with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign), cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This did not extend the clinical data base to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you require further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, it is admittedly available as a solution to use, but this cannot be taken together with kritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgeneracy should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Amethase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Amethase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids cannot be cured, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby the development of infected infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Amethase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two major studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Amethase, which was enhanced with low doses of ritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not previously taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks in general, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Amethase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Amethase also reduced viral load, but only very few responded to the treatment of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the Amethase drug used to treat viral load after 16-week treatment was as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Amethase, together with ritonavir, came to a stronger drop in viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Amethase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), nausea, vomiting, rash, and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Achiase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amsprinklavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Amethase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals that are degraded just like apherase and are detrimental to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, the benefits of HIV-1-infected adults and children were outweighed over four years against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Amethase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic kritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of asgeneracy in combination with ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Amethase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the placing of Agroase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Amethase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children aged 4 and older.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Amethase capsules should be given to the pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pre-treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, asgenerase capsules and solution for taking on one milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Amethase capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agroase capsules are applied without the enhancing additive of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Amethase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Amethase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amsprinklavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to the lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Amethase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunctions, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">It may not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present the substrate of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amsprinklavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Amethase or any other antiretroviral therapy will not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with apporase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Amethase capsules must be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medications (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing restricted liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin are strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of apportionate with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, amatase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amptomavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored on ompiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolon content of the asgenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with caution against certain other patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenerase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an existing type of diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug addicts, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hailed patients (type A and B), which were treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemthropoids are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 medium with a low therapeutic width of Amethase may not simultaneously be used with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present the substrate of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Amethase with kritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amsprinklavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a development of resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by adding other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already receives St. John's wort, the amsprinkling levels and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax, by contrast, reduced by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg amsprinklavir were applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of prenavir in plasma obtained at the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily) are about 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was performed in combination with dianase in combination with didanosine, but due to the antazidi component of Didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amptomavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amsprinklavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine possibly lowers the serum concentration of amsprinklavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Should these drugs be used at the same time, caution is advised, since Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution must be advised; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amptomavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in a rise in plasma concentrations (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, thereby increasing the side-effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with asgenerase, the dosage of rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Amethase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) at 2.69fold in comparison to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including mediums, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4, may lead to interactions when used together with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as apherase as it can result in absorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsants known as inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of amsprinklavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Feldenpin, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amsprinklavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with asgenerase may increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Amethase with ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as administase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma concentrations of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to stabilization of the mirrors, as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amsprinklavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">For this reason, asgeneracy should not be applied together with orally taken midazolam (see section 4.3) while using parenteral Midazolam with parenteral Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored on ompiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment, such as the Amprenatal dose, if Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Increased control of INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended for the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with asgenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as administase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Prenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactating rats, but it is not known whether prenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given to ampersavir from desolation to the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenerase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-effects associated with the Achiase treatment were mild to moderate, appeared early and rarely led to treatment interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to taking Amethase or other medicines used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Amethase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocrative fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Only one case (Stiernacken) (&lt; 1%) was observed under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons who had been treated with amsprinklavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTI- pretreated patients were found in Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin eruptions were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makuloaf nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amsprinklavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Amethase twice a day together with low dose kritonavir (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception was increases of the triglycerid and CPK values obtained in patients who received asgeneracy together with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of intoxiation (see section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral and gag-pol- polyesters with the consequence of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of prenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0,08 µM for acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in the case of chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of prenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir-based treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the case of sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred by week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of ampersavir / ritonavir / ritonavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions on the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to alterations by additional data, and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Analyses based on phenotypic resistance tests clinical validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of ampersavir / ritonavir / ritonavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies developing diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret test results.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir produces a certain resistance to kritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistence paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral unpretreated patients with a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), Darrelavir / ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), quinavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), quinavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors isolates; maintaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">Evidence of the efficacy of Amethase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PROFIB17, a randomised open study in which with PI pretreated adults treated with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanoga (NRTI) or a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards asgenerase, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the Part Study A of PROFIB17.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis was the non-supremacy of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-capillary wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgeneracy is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Amethase was tested twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agroase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1-RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) versus the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefits of" "" "unborn" "" "Achiase should be taken into consideration when optimizing therapy with PI-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the medium duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of ampere avir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax, by contrast, reduced by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of ampere-avir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">For this reason, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amponavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time using asgenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Amethase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily prenatal exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with imiquimodine-cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating properties imiquimodine should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the connection or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither after once nor after repeated topical application quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been achieved, no recommendation can be made to use during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine-Cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the site of treating the cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most frequently reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of the imiquimodine-cream in connection with side effects include complaints at the application ort with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with imiquimodine-cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical study reported side-effects listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse effect, possibly or possibly associated with the application of the imiquimodine-cream, was a response in these studies (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects listed in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with Imiquimodine-creme-treated patients with actin keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three-week treatment with Imiquimodine-Cream, it frequently came to local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), excretion / scrolling (23%) and oestrogen (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine, severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scarring and carbonization (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral absorption of 200 mg of imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotony that normalized itself to oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic analysis, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after topical application of Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the cowards with an Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients who had been treated with imiquimodine, the cowards were completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the patients with placebo who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Full healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with imiquimodine treated male patients, compared to 5% from 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine at five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed single primary superficial BCCs with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area of treatment on the hairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical consecration after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">In paediatric patients, the permitted indications of external feignices, actin keratose and superficial cellulose carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies at the dosages there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic uptake of the 5% imiquimodine cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed during the three-week use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half-life after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actin Keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four month study of dermal toxicity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study of the dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is unknown, but since Imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for people to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours performed in the group of mice treated with the drug-free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2243">● Feignices (Condylomata acuminata) which have formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and the anus (anus). this is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actin keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in shallow actin keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actin keratose or the virus responsible for infection with cowards.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning under the foreskin is not carried out, swelling, fertiliser of the skin or difficulty in withdrawing the foreskin can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not apply Aldara cream in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications may have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse during infection with cowards in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not previously) will perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimodine enters into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment is different in case of cowards, basal cell carcinoma and actin keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin with the cowards and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2) What do you need to consider before using Aldara cream? ").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream for 6 weeks each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too much to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further, wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A degraded number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue stain to occur more quickly or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects you are considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of the patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara Cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which will disappear within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application place (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, Hautzbrinolytis, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the enzymatic therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, aggravate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reactions.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect in the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years old, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60% and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever, and reactions on the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring magnitude of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check every year all new information that may be known, and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the marketing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammals cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzymatic therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mukopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which reinvigoration facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase III study, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against laronidase are expected, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in resuming treatment after a longer break, it is necessary to carefully proceed with the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion-induced reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are brought to a drop, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interferenz with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As there is no data on newborns exposed to breast milk compared to laronidase, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and in 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions including bronchospasm, airstillness and facial oil (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe prescriptions and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 e / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a Serokonversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a severe delay in patients under 5 years of age (average after 26 days compared to 45 days with patients at age 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 trial (or up to a premature ejection from the study), 13 / 45 patients showed no anti-radioimmunophagetic (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it never came to a Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody tides a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzymatic replacement therapy lies in a sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity for hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and is absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study involving the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients in the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the difficult phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected feed and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for a further 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and viability in the placebo group shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear decrease of the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg of creatine) was detected, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In view of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients that was taken into account by using a combined end point (expected percentage normal FeV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe delay and 4 with the average oral form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated Gag- Mirror in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with severe delay (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas the older patients with severe progression could only have limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyma dosage schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 e / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, an additional "anti-drug" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluid) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood-image changes, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, discontinued or the dose be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural light, Alimta was examined in a major study on 456 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study on 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin showed an average of 12.1 month compared to 9,3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom cancer did not attack the squamous cells during the administration of Alimta showed longer survival compared to the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every screw-through has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% of the sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see paragraph 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is given intravenous infusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenous infusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed-Gift as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetreet, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first Pemetremixed dosage as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetremixed, a complete blood-image should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and thrombocyte enumeration.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under consideration of the Nadir of the hemorrhage or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if there is a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 or so- fort he incidence of 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or older than 65 years of age there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adjustments that go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold the upper Bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-times the upper limit value (in the absence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone marosuppression and Pemetremixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils again have a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet number again has a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-hematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was bebiased if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous taking of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetrexed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, a drainage of the effusion in the transcellular space should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in front of the Pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were sometimes reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible bleaching of the reproductive capacity by Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment tin to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g a day) can result in reduced Pemetremixed expulsion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advised if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can be used high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetremixed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs are available with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Norised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- and antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in case of an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy, unless absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment begins to consult with regard to the sperm storage.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomised cisplatin and Pemetremixed and 163 people with mesothelioma who randomly received cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetremixed acts as an antifolate with several targets by blocking the thyme dylatynthase (TS), Dihydrological reductase (DHFR) and glycoamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis by Thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaious patients with a maligthin pleural comelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had clinically significant survival compared to those patients who were only injected with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took alli 60 mg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no loss of weight could be observed for patients.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalypical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimal resorbed, the elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not need adjustment of the dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic check, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli because the dose of the antidiabetic must be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta-carotins remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers receiving orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects found after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† Es is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight individuals without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lipase inhibitory properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serin-rest of the gastric and pankrebic hair passages.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was estimated that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalypical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight versus the initial value (at the time of randomization), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of studies (Table 1) and as a share of those participating in study, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">Waist circumference was about 4.5 cm with Orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral dosage of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in the plasma could be detected only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving obese patients with minimal systemic stress, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-molyl leucine group), could be identified, representing nearly 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The potency of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-medicine).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alohxi was examined in three major studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission informed the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Aloxi across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly-etogenic chemotherapy due to cancers and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that prolong the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is not used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutics studied against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, chlorpromaine, fluoxetine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, reanitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (633 patients), which were at least associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery site (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar occurrences of undesirable events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effects relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were conducted, but due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy for an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms of palonosetron (half-life 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life sentence of 7.3 hours) given in day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron, given intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with medically emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular deportation and repression and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The goal of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of the intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to IV dosage, an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.390 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the IV dose of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean average (± SD) increase of the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) reached at once daily intravenous dosage of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable with the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the intake of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unmodified substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearances 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver dysfunctions increase the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficient above the maximum humanistic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. preclinical studies indicate that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolonging the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and as Aloxi is determined in humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report, in which the approval of the authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal properties that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheleon submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheleon has been compared to the efficacy of the reference physician to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheleon, the disease flamed up again in more patients than in the reference medicinal product; Alpheleon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug detects an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected infirations (cracking or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinoresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used for patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age the skin area to be treated must not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was terminated at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of 139 patients under the age of Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough for the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union to the company Glaxo Group Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitizing or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infections, the efficacy of retinamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs after a 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on deported skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole the middle retinamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% on the skid skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity following oral intake and are insufficient regarding a statement on the effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinapamulin balance should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of reapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is necessary to consider the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefits of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have used Altargo, the most frequently reported side effect was irritation at the date of delivery about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide transfer, block partial P binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin at least some types of infection appears questionable, a consultation with experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in vitro activity of retinamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied on a daily basis under occlusion and applied to the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 weakened skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism of the in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro investigation of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat-microkernel test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby an exposure reached up to 5 times was reached as the highest appreciated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 weakened skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were diagnosed in oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2), is present and works before the product is marketed and used as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorisation for placing on the market is committed to carrying out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities in the Pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use," the updated RMP is to be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not explicitly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment slips on one of these areas, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambitions are applied as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Therefore, ambitions may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunisation and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dosage is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambience or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by helping the immune system (the natural defences of the body) "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccine ELrix Children permitted since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect against the same diseases, however, in the context of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses, Twinlock adults and twin Irix Children are administered.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambience and Twinlock adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data which support the application of Twinlock adults were also used as a proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) include headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matiness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission informed the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for placing Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for priming with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-hepatitis A virus) are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured whether immunocompetent persons who have referred to hepatitis A vaccination need a booster as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">After the priming of haemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody-value, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraoperative injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success in the gluteal muscles, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambience can be injected by subcutaneous injections as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambience was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mason-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matterity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomers and preservative-containing vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were given to a total of 1027 inoculations between 1 and 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matiness on a basis for calculation per vaccine Ambience, but not on a basis for calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the application of Ambirix with 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects according to the dose of a 3-doses-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects received Ambience reported pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects which had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matrience was comparable to that of 39.6% of subjects who got Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses-combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pronounced pain and fatigue was small and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-doses-combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per Proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccination at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were 1 month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose-administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose-administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambience and 147 were awarded the standard combinationsimmering vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambirix in the month of 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunological responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after munization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatic A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable to that in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time as a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotect- and seroconversion rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to investigate possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes both before and after the conclusion of the resin.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require hospitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before administration of both vaccinations (although you / your child may not feel ill or ill at the time of the vaccine), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any ingredient of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Allergic reaction may be caused by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the normally planned administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constituents per vaccination (360 ELISA Units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected by persons suffering from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / its body's defenses, or if you / your child undergo a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambitions can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medications (including those that you can get without prescribing) or if you / your child was recently vaccinated / has received / has received immunoglobuline (antibodies) / has or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine needs to be given with Ambirix at the same time, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambience should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data known as the first authorization for placing on the market, CHMP felt that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambience remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was put into circulation only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonica can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrointestinal hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nose secretion (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammonica could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a fake medicine, that is, without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonica can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, loss of taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonica was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because due to the rarity of the disease, only limited information about this drug was available at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzymatic defect that manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if a hyperammonic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthesis or orniintranscarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets cannot be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as esophagusulcera is a risk when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) of sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyl concentrate on the liver and kidneys are carried out, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in slowing of neuronal propagation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS during breastfeeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients at least an adverse event (AE) occurred and at 78% of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old toddler with an inadvertent single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity with an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phenylbutyate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is initiated at an early stage and treatment is immediately started in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infested, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through haemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrous oxide, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn infants in postpartal (but within the first life-month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the orniintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are rarely reversible during treatment and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is secreted with glutamine in the liver and kidney, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">After different dosages of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after nightly fast no phenylacetate was detected in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Following the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyl concentrate with toxic and non-toxic cans did not have any carcinogenic effects (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (babies and children who can't swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrointestinal chime or nose secretion.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthesis or orniintranscarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-pipes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), lesions in the brain-cows of the brain-cows came to lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phenylbutyate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are rarely reversible during treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon is 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication by a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products that accumulate in the body after consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are conducted with you, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may enter the breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disorders, deprivation of ear, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox was compared with the use of a Glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) compared to conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent the closure), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without administration of GPI - in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was just as effective as heparin in terms of all indicators except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalidin, other hirudine or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of Angiox across the European Union to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous stantion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical necessity.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a yield of 0,5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolt offering from Angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the patient dose can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalidin-Bolus with no dose adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis-based patients, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after finishing the IV dose of unfractional heparin or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of low molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding due to malfunctioning of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bleinner disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis-based patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of the hemorrhages occur in the case of PCI patients under Bivalidate, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can generally occur during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with a bivaliant, a monitoring of the INR value (International Norised Ratio) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivalirudin again reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregators), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivaliddin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostatic parameters are checked regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalidated alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unquestionable heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the benevolent group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings have been defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleedings as defined in Table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliddin plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reducing the haemoglobin level ≥ 4 g / dl with well known bleeding area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed hemorrhages, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctuation points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on the data from a clinical trial with Bivalidated in 6000 patients who have undergone a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivaliddin group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are grouped according to system organcategories in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosage, the treatment with the patient is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombine inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalidated to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalidated patients had no thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / thrombocytopenia / thrombocytopenia / thrombocytopenia / thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is confirmed by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was subsequently carried out in the patients, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalidated should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Arm A and B patients were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before angiography (at the time of randomization) or in PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were spread evenly over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and the 1- year point for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol (before the angiography or prior to PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopdogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 An ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neales, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reducing the haemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding area, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double-blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalidated were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivaliddin as peptide passes a catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4-binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10 times of clinical steady-state plasma concentrations) restricted to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects following a longer-term physiological burden as a response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to those in clinical application, even at a very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the production of ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lousin is very slightly different from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active life than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in the application in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot operate insulin effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined in six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin embryos.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration amounted to 0.46% after six months with Apidra, compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisine or any other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneously into the area of the abdominal sacs by continuous infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose availability and the reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Every change of the effective strength, the brand (producers), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can change the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, vaporide (MAO) inhibitors, Pentoxifyllin, Propoxyphene, Salizylate and Sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic medicines such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reservation the symptoms of adrenergies can be attenuated or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin action occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed in clinical studies are listed according to system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on available data not estimable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive hun-, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is neglected to continually change the injection area within the injection range, may result in a light podystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a suitably trained person or treated by a doctor through intravenous administration of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous GA- be of insulin action the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes melli-, insulin lulipsin showed a dose proportional glucosylating effect from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg and a disproportionate increase in the glucose effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lousin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosylating effect about 2 hours earlier as a human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that during an application of insulin lulipsin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandiale glycaemic control is reached like with a humanoid normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lucsin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale control was achieved than with a human normal insulin injected 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lucsin is turned on 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nuds before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lucsin in 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to a normal insulin analog, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin Sullisine administered 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malininsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
