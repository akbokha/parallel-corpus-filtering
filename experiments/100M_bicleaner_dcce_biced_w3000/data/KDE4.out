machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations do not make important decisions , without checking the translation before .
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated by yourself on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert text to be translated .
package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
further information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Setup Wizard ... Open the card map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the node ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on Tools &gt; Acc@@ eler@@ ate . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of crashes , if any , er@@ ase .
the view filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the ad starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and label settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap display algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this framework will need space , which is then lost to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
the implementation of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can set the minimum area for an entry on the menu item View An@@ no@@ unc@@ ement with Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you call the module picture gallery , a dialog box opens which allows you to specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a rotary field to set the number of thumb@@ nails each line in the gallery .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and directly download your photos . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes quick image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded using K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens to search for .
as all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to report problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests ... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you use these short@@ cuts , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all the information you need is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project supported by a community . that is , users and developers help each other . if you are a regular user by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can ask questions here to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , English is spoken in this mailing list , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance to report in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
if you are editing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data store is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ code ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; considers any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to do extra &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; complete a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon . this will then be used as a album symbol . for more details , see the albums section .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up and digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Sam@@ ples to manage your photos in the albums .
raw File Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ cam ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Program@@ ming and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and directly download your photos . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever @-@ increasing number of over 800 cameras . photo Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association , allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails from digi@@ c@@ am . the Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; , K@@ Photos Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; even perform itself .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree tree , above the horizontal dividing line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can &apos;t be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to make the most popular : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter will only be used for the fields currently displayed in the toolbar . this will only show the filtering on the file name if it is displayed as a symbol view . which fields can be displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . to do so , select Import Pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the destination album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select Edit Fol@@ der Properties from the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos when you want to add or delete albums from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the oldest , average , new : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . for this purpose , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first image of the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and drop in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Key@@ word list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this allows you to avoid using all the thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the preview . what information these are can be edited by digi@@ ti@@ sed ; set up the Albums tab here and adjust the preview images to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse @-@ cursor leave a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can view all the functions with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and selecting Edit ... . in the Edit section ; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need does not provide . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to this , and how to customize it to your needs , see &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing by other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for turning . the easiest way is to right @-@ click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; er@@ ase , it is moved to the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; move F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del if you want to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ der quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ d@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported at the loss of the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ kam ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you click on a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting keywords in the context menu . you can change the keyword name and icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and put it in the context menu As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to handle all the functionality with keywords , first you need to add keywords . this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can also click on the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select cue points from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords attached to it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear in the main window under preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you open the context menu of the photo using the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you just need to click the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this displays all the corresponding images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
next to the search box is a small lamp the green will find when searching find matches . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything then the lamp will be red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs inside the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you entered as search criterion . after you have saved it appeared filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press OK and the search will be executed . the results will be displayed in the View My Search List in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search List and select an option from the contex@@ tual menu .
when you choose to edit your search , the form to input the search will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you choose to edit as extended search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
in case you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu Search .
Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields by &amp; digi@@ plug ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted from it . any option can be added to this list using the Lo@@ gical Operations All ... , One ... , N@@ one ... or at least ... . furthermore , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NE@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this enables images to compare by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ess , the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the matching pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out or hold it . move it while you hit the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a lighting table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the lighting table from the context menu . the selection is added to the illuminated table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize the preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the images , you can also compare the same range of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you are using p@@ airing from the toolbar , the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for loading . now , use the left mouse button on any preview image to view it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lighting table such as F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can spot on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the picture , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in mode preview , both images will show the same image area .
just use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out . this happens in both images when you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , archiving , optimizing , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles , manufactures and exports content that has a monetary or cultural asset . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer a certain photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you maintain anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive some@@ time .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies securing strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived picture .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the file &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item from the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ cam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should assign words , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next job .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , such as many other programs , or continue to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically insert the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ cam ; updated while the sub@@ tree is tra@@ cked .
the graph shows how different metadata overl@@ aps . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone else just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;ll tell you that this is the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand what you are moving about .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images . K@@ DE even provides a spell ch@@ ecker . you do not have to tell the story any second time for the illustration and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical details . &amp; digi@@ cam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you export with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information about the editing page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be like : employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a comment on the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who uses the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , these organisations can be listed here , which you offer the image to others . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify them in the picture . for individuals this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the near future , it will provide such a module for batch processing .
topics : panel error , plate failure , power sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which cause data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be handled carefully and you can &apos;t trust them for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you are just written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and the check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . after that , read the data back to verify you . likewise , you should mark the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals . do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
Disk@@ manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives available on this subject :
shortly : disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in case of lower temperature , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot determine this error . this is in particular read errors and publishing counter . the expected life time amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t make a lot of power , this can cause heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage to your computer . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it complies with the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to store your data and run down the system . if you purchase a UPS , you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its safety in case of current problems with the costs of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 % , A 500@@ W UPS you can get for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . at the end , you should always remember how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offering you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed into photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed storage .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs secure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these disrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day there should be no protection for it . nobody seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than the one on your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a lower level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard compati@@ bel . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebooks and 46 % for work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ est file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limitations . this means that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . therefore , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives .
suppose you take your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will have you lucky if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget about aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to the neighbour house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete Backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes with a compression system next with the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure lets you have enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come out for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , stored in the image file associated IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet .
to enable valuable images to survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you need to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alisation is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have included the scal@@ ability and the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record was recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # functions with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software exists that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG can be used as an open source standard , but it can much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it has relative lot of administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression . we would like to recommend this format to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as an image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
the Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed because of the need to uni@@ fy the camera ear formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provides D@@ NG and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource blocking &amp; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive their image , mostly in raw format , to archive them . however , X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , the raw format can be switched . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Adding a Photos to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use it , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn on it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the camera will be displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata displays internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS etc of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and download Sel@@ ected . the selected button will be gra@@ yed as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not yet been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , of course , only the new images are downloaded .
if you are using the All Download or download buttons , a dialog box appears to select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown , like normal folders . you can read details on the folder sorting in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete the deleted ones .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . the photos will not be moved into the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera reader , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder is created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the Standard Auto Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want another date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do so , turn off the date &amp; time option . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case . or upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to enable automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata , you can read more about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ cam ; this uses to automatically upload sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data , you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in that case it saves &amp; digi@@ code ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based lower at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download the button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the images should be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can click on a browser to display the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ing and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS receivers to work together . either as a map module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the module for geographical assignment .
there exist various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool from Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the del@@ im@@ ited coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; try to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that have the behavior of Edit digi@@ kam ; you need to select set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be set to a saved preview or start image editing . so you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the image that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of another &amp; quot ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database from &amp; digi@@ kam . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; imported without being lost .
image lab@@ eling as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other picture viewers . attention : for images that already contain cap@@ tions , they are over@@ written by the edited notes .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .

the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button update to the right of each category .
the panel settings are set to the default values . each time you open the illuminated table these settings can be turned on when possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one then you can obtain better view results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you are using image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a dark@@ er or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance density than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the PNG @-@ compression option you can reduce the size of .@@ p@@ n@@ g files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn on the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on the image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting Los@@ s@@ less JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing .
when you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option shows the image a little soft , eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance based on a white card photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ supplied images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned into it , because of the inability of your camera to capture the top lights in the settings . the setting colors will trigger some unusual results since it shows the pointed lights in various pink tones . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels generally are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ p therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the Edit &amp; Edit page . to keep the time for the demo small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . however , as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adaptive homogen@@ eity @-@ direction ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction as it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from one color space to the other is to be translated in order for the colors to be as exact as possible .
behavior issues when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you save all your profiles .
settings of ICC Pro@@ files You have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera cre@@ ators and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color @-@ mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image of a device would be returned . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of getting on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for . unfortunately not with models from Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use and these are then uploaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings brief commands .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features on the left hand side show a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . below are the port settings . currently , here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / more , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check out whether &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; View images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the Di@@ alogue of &amp; Edit ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details in the del@@ eting a photos and deletion of an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly done by &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without using any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also make the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ cam ; to stop when starting . this will , in some circumstances , accelerate the boot process from &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
searching for new photos will force &amp; digi@@ cam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something is deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ cam ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; Edit ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to create , find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; includes quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting Edit / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , zoom factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most needed functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or button The Rest@@ ore image processing button in the toolbar . you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by choosing Edit Rep@@ eat or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Re@@ production from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should use the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the toolbar or Rest@@ ore button on the toolbar for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current picture , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button on the toolbar : select En@@ larger Factor Automati@@ cally
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you are using the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change it in the Settings dialog from &amp; Edit . you can view it from the Edit Pan@@ e ; main window . see the section to set up image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can choose to print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select Export wizard from the Album View menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field of Ur@@ gency . the code follows the schema in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box that previously appeared in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when typ@@ ing keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is shown . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog box appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the example above , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is written on no words , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created it and find that it should be one or two , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I was mainly adapting it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable departure from the actually photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make sure to make informed decisions about color management . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions in order to obtain the desired result .
if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by email or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to register my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ g@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your monitor is calibr@@ ated by s@@ RGB . if you are working as a colour space of s@@ RGB , then you must either calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
compens@@ ating : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light limits and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
enhance contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a real@@ location of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because there is a color space of 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can run too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful since , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow calibration allows you to improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons make this exactly . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and re@@ charge it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , comp@@ ut@@ ational time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find in the menu under colors ton@@ ality correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use these for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; the colour effects tool provides you with four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar pol@@ arization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect created by using a partial pressure of a short flash light and afterwards complete the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate photographic paper inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar pol@@ arization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately produces a negative picture that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar efficiency factor . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) applied . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via &apos;s highly saturated colors are also a few phot@@ oc@@ ograph@@ s , especially those of which hardly agree to landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your Jus@@ ti@@ fications can be previ@@ ewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can carry out can be previ@@ ewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
the tool tone correction is located between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple den@@ ial / contrast / g@@ amma . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ ders for the application purpose explained here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . below the graph are three sli@@ ders that can be cli@@ cked in and shifted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and take care of how the image changes .
on the right hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically using the image &apos;s settings . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear representation is often the most useful . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatic : this button automatically sets the image values depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and Sonn@@ ent@@ öne . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and no effect is seen in the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
the left hand side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
a modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode further helps .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example , the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the corresponding image pixels .
a red marker is displayed on the preview of the original photo . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you are found in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and no effect is seen in the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the Edit &amp; Edit Chann@@ els Mixer ; image processing is a tool to enhance color channels or change the color h@@ ues of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first clu@@ e how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the destination image has a red marker . if you position this in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you need to retain lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well as you enable the Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me option , as the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate superb black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the far@@ med . it consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and no effect is seen in the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is checked . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves the scenery , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ Epi@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of col@@ dness in sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ece . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ Epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture applying image editing can be used for it .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photograph below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the Edit &amp; Edit ; Add tool frame can be added to a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . passing the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce finishes it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture in any position . this is also possible in several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the Edit &amp; Edit tool you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu applied in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the digi@@ plug ; Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ datenbank , please send an email in English to the digi@@ cam ; mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the Fol@@ der button in the dialog box . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder will automatically update the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm is taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complex in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without a focus and most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to sum up colors with only minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color pixels are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera has often been used for internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers are already using a focus filter while scanning the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to use the menu item Cor@@ rection sharp@@ ness .
you should , however , be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image can re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sign sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should be best sharpen@@ ed in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference . it is therefore possible to define a minimum difference in order to apply for an edge of the filters . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpen@@ ing and therefore plastic f@@ laws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted de@@ f@@ alt@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to shar@@ pen a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focus generally achieves better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ el@@ ines that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold is influenced by the distant pixels , causing un@@ desired results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set higher value if your image is very blur@@ red then pay attention to hal@@ o tickets .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . the values are 0.5 and the values are near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further lubric@@ ate the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ accuracy is Gau@@ ß &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by causing blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , blur@@ red mask must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied to a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red colour image must be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the smooth@@ ness of the regulator has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here .
the tool error correction tool is one of the most advanced tool for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogen@@ ous regions and let details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary subsequently .
directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated with a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ el@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is difficult to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeat : specifies how often the algorithm is going to go through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long runtime . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of less than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel @-@ smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the Save as and Load buttons make this exactly . each setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
correc@@ ting image errors is compar@@ ably very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that was caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter will no longer be able to get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : control edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise or noise peaks may occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the tolerance tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically more strongly smo@@ ked . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations in the lumin@@ ance density . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges .
save under and Load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied using standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sign the sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration process gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Load buttons make this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is compar@@ ably very fast at work . however , it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious screen capture on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were used to reduce an old colour photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defective .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note here that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and re@@ charges it again in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the next pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel Cor@@ rection on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
it also has disadvantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the ir@@ is filter , which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances , making it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller as there are otherwise blur@@ ring effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and grey gra@@ ding depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection turns the transformation with a center filter onto a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reducing the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , set the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of 4 degrees fixes the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite del@@ im@@ iter of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the size of the image and results in a correction of the first degree . the negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ onal or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best result in this correction than first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong one .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image editing or using the Zoom controllers of this dialog .
for most images , the barrel @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate inf@@ ra @-@ red film of G@@ Imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is accessible under this URL . the filter rep@@ lic@@ ates the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add movie grain when you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos since the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers combine large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight , especially in your mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic photos , you need to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and G@@ lä@@ tte 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sketch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you had chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave Blocks 2 : analog to the wavel@@ ength 1 , the image is distorted along with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : blur@@ red the image along star shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train , camera .
soft drawing blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ utter@@ ing sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ bs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the picture .
you can use the Edit menu to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of a rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the menu Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ating or Trans@@ forming mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how you can infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it by yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Trans@@ form Size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , for example sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm phot@@ oc@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ em@@ ming for photo can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by magni@@ fying a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save button under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview range , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained .
after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . R@@ atio knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
after aspect ratio the tool stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image sizes are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the context settings help you to make the most of your images together , so that you can better compile your images . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonious pitches are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural patterns of growth , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden middle provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ third rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates in this way a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that draws the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als can be placed on these lines more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect of professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you take a photo , it &apos;s easy to hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can fix this with the Edit &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select Trans@@ form Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown to the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a print to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ s the picture a bit after the rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ate . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : displays the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
angle at the top left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle at the top right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with trans@@ formations from the image processing .
the sh@@ ading tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . for example , a horizontal shift will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a right angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
she@@ ar your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two sh@@ utter@@ ing produces twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing the image has un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove it is to cut the image with trans@@ formations from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done by means of file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ cam ; the file in the image editing is displayed . you can change this list of file extensions &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; please refer to the Configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format pictures to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ cam ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capability to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program to play .
go forward to the previously visited record in the chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward if you &apos;ve gone back before .

K@@ IP@@ I module that exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ red mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before applying the filter to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview pane .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizontally . the upper part shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview range and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this box with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar Properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out or hold it . move it while you hit the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for choosing and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes loaded by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and Hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files .
the cursor is shown as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let view . here also the color name can be changed .
to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled under the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ rides a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode you can adjust by selecting the check box Over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created in such a way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste operations .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end sign if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; Gra@@ ph ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; node program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; to . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; -@@ component
loading large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs .
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list will open the opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file was modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later as will proceed . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or to represent the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can let all graphs of your last session be opened again . again , you can save your choice both later and later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph .

the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load site gives you the option of setting behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session administration page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( opening or not opening the files of the last session or not ) or determining to be asked every time you start .
the context menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; appears , opens up additional options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the default graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm determines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ processed graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for un@@ realised graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm as@@ signs the nodes in a circular shape according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command executed by a shell . the command should give the graph file as parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can &amp; eg ; the graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms to change specific options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directional or un@@ executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ executed graphs ) .
if this setting is checked , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes images to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item Pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will display by changing the default values of your own to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner . read the K@@ oo@@ ka manual for more information .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to specify the destination image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting from the Import @-@ &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears where you can set different screen@@ shots :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other areas of work , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the Options dialog appears with the options described above .

the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be run through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is launched to allow you to login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will see the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access rights that the module displays . to upload , you need write permission . the module currently does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button Add Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the keyword field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the Options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value that is registered with Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS trace as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same locations at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera pairs need to be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for GPS time and camera pairs . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog box the coordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , choose the region and enlarge it . you can always select the amount manually . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will show the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option for each picture creates a page creates a gallery where each picture gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ;
the Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . to do this , select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Error , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images .
with Other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails display allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program end@@ ings to see if errors during the creation have occurred . the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to carry out basic operations such as twi@@ sting , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image will be shown in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to store images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual losses of quality and metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata @-@ module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then open the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . the data will be copied after clicking the OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please refer to exi@@ v2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ di@@ der module is a tool for converting a series of images into an MPEG video in form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module will use the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a basic image transfer between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be zi@@ pped into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture will be displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g as close as possible .
if you provide an audio file with the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . once you have adjusted all the settings according to your preferences , you can start a coffee with the encoding button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee or enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button Settings on the bottom right .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion by using the button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the score and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . to do so , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : resi@@ zing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre@@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred E @-@ Mail program . it is possible to change the size of the images to be sent earlier . you can drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images to the image selection dialog with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add to the list of images to be sent .
with the Del@@ ete button you will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at one time . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is complete , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . by closing this window , you can lock this window .
after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Show file names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensures that the filen@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used to order the images in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the slideshow .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date still has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo album ; Browse through these , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , now there are entries in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in the group keyword entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to search for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
if you hit people with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images appear on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can with &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , for each person to store your own thumb@@ nail , this is of course also true for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the context menu appears , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual person . to do so , you need to open the image view window ( described in detail ) and select the category editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can customize the enlargement factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you visit the search in the main window , you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the label or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you will see images on which Jes@@ per but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for the photo@@ album . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and take a look at the Quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; for the first time launch , or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ Album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name already says , this bar displays you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will see in the preview pane only images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; introduces you two options to create html web pages with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ photo album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo album is described ; integrated version that you can create from the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo album ; HTML example pages you will see an example for these settings .
next , select whether to create a photo album ; export file that is to be seen on the overview page . next information about the export files you will find in .
finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information appearing to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo album ; currently all images are exported . you can &apos;t use this setting so as to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not download images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , it can scan your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best way to do this is to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to specify the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will have to copy them manually . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have all three related to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo album ; coming together , you may want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to make with &amp; k@@ photo album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or whether there is only a link to images in the file . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can share all the images and pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu File ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . of course , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file with the HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
to copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally Copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . however , if you want to do so , simply select the option Export File .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo album ; the exported database as described in described .
the Import Wizard consists of four steps . first , you need to choose which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; if you look at images of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend , you may want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps from ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and will automatically re@@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can also start a different folder tree with pictures , you can &amp; k@@ photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ Photo@@ Album ; set up ... get to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo album ; in the following section of the user manual we will explain the different settings options .
on the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access to the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the option you want .
you can define how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in this section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , most modules possess a help page , which you can call via the modules themselves .
since the modules of several applications are common among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should first try out new modules with the demo database before using them using the command &gt; k@@ night album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications put their pictures into albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo album ; this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates some modules the order after albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo album .
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo album ; the current album that simply matches the current view , so all the images that show you the preview of the picture at the moment .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here you go to the photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category individuals , &amp; k@@ photo album ; so do so , if you would have chosen persons to view the module and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen once you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool bar at the top . under the toolbar you will see the window that you have entered into your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information as you don &apos;t have any information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo album ; is the possibility to mark any picture with comments . this includes information about the persons who are recorded in the picture , where the image has been recorded etc . you can set each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in addition , you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations , and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo album , because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can so that the used names are moved up , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the S@@ ort by date icon on the list .
if you have selected any comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to them . in this case , simply click on the thumb@@ nails and back buttons below the image to the right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item to provide multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
the picture shows a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special icon will be displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also simply drag and drop an entry to a category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... that offers , among other things , the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also om@@ it a frame completely . if you want to get this window shown later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all images in case you haven &apos;t set any filters . you can see an example here . you can configure the thumb@@ nails size by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo album ; namely , use images without having you saved on your hard drive . of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo album ; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is truncated , are not stored on the hard drive . however , this is available for images 1 @-@ 9 . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy and paste files from the folders . &amp; k@@ photo album ; it doesn &apos;t support you up to now to ask for the CD . so if you &apos;re in trouble , how to avoid browsing your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make in@@ accessible and click on the Current View menu in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can see , and select the menu entry Every@@ thing except current view .
with this , you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so that all images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on one hand , everyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to forbi@@ d those who are with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not very familiar with looking at private images .
the reason you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours is of course that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo album features an image _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed at all . all of these options are available right click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the matching entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and image down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete screen space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move in and out of the image . you can use the mouse to zoom in with the mouse . the Plus button zo@@ oms out in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zoom .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the uni@@ formity function sets the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image on the screen .
note that the only zoom @-@ operations that work with videos are that in and out are zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to just mark the picture and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to display images with features as you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view a picture with which features A , B and C are set .
once you have attributes to your images , they are available in your browser . you can see this in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , you simply provide all of them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window . if you can view categories in a thumb@@ nail , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the attribute after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can und@@ o your painting later .
to switch off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; select on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views is displayed yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene using either the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct and re @-@ click the input errors or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Properties view .
press Pre@@ view in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window layout as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it freely . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs on the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating elev@@ ations : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the start on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the Anf@@ al bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... Save . a dialog will display where you can save the window layout under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 actual . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon Add the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender modes ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the size of the map you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the combination @-@ field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive , because the super @-@ sampling refers to the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam per pixel . if the difference between colour values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually tra@@ cked further and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays didn &apos;t hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for that here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select File Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set by &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
when you click on Help in the Properties view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . here , set the path to your retention and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in paths to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you display a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window orders . in the window dressing section explains how to create and store window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ed Standard Window arrangement : displays all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window layout when starting the program .
the Add Window Reg@@ ulations list displays all existing window classi@@ fications . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window layout . new views can be created with the Add button and select selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with card card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering does not anchor the view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth clin@@ cher view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the term camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you apply the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a cad@@ re ( insertion final body cu@@ bo@@ id ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to resolve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the + in front of the object . you will see only the default options for each new object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first object . the pigment will then change in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and bul@@ let in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then click the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now by clicking on the icon , you should obtain the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the check@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one @-@ color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should already be done simply because you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy to create as the floor :
in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or Apply button ) , so the ball has floating above the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , set up a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First Sub@@ ject and change the name for example in ball pigment . click on ball pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection settings result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even when Met@@ alli@@ c is not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you are using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye to which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene that should be rendered is some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu entry if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Re@@ play .
stores the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or over@@ ride an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , keyboard short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to modify or add new short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to manipul@@ ate each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching filen@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the setup - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point activates , loads &amp; balls show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when ending the name of the recently opened folder . at the next launch opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types that the program can display .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarge the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; editing based on the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
and show photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry Reports you problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is filled out and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
and show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that is , users and developers help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you can ask questions about other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best way to join the show@@ photo ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instruction to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
and show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of a show@@ photo ; you have to choose to set up the settings . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . skill@@ fully the colors should be in contrast with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than images to scan and save .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes as images to scan and save . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE website by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel becomes &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not deal with these options .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started using the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is stored and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be stored automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time high when an image is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About launches the K@@ DE Via dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for setting and closing can be used to quit &amp; channel .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and choosing Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific short@@ cuts you can set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and select short@@ cuts ...
you can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this way you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not work .
added require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and ste@@ er Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command to join any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default settings and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore occur@@ ren@@ ces if there is no use for it .
configure Your script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok put the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece ( e.g. the metadata or unit length ) with D@@ CO@@ P functions .
volume Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le P@@ aths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add your own entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform , for example , clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name like e. g. mein@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ big@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an exhaus@@ tion cat@@ amar@@ an script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag and drop music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title from thousands of your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Coll@@ ap@@ se browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists choose the right music automatically according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s i@@ Ph@@ ones , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you shouldn &apos;t have trouble comp@@ iling . if you encounter any problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
certain dependen@@ cies must be met for some of the comp@@ iling options so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requirements section .
activates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; easily set up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to displaying the player window , the player window will additionally switch to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . this changes the used color scheme for the tun@@ er bar@@ ometer .
put mood files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you want to save , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist .
relative paths for play@@ lists stored manually : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window will pop up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible area of the window .
when changing the piece to the context browser , automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting own fonts , the otherwise gray presented section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
re@@ play at the start causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors do not apply , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the Display Text entry field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the Screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify the screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate more settings in this card map .
the collection card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to specify how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the selected and their sub@@ folders to music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m specifies the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
access similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will access a list of similar performers to the each played piece . you can see the list in the context browsers . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the functions and gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find , for example , modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ ok@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the daily Li@@ b library . you can locate the file using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time , this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more sophisticated .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open during a crash ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be resolved .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ Infos , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Rep@@ eti@@ tion / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be easily forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixels , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ca app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are easily solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only make a mistake there if something is at your fault in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Display Review . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop them down , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the playlist toolbar , right next to the Add button , the playlist button is to be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be what types of media types are supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer even can de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 clo@@ d , Enter key
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ O co@@ dec@@ s that can cause distorted playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine instead , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less beams react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . perform follow @-@ up registers to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t work , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder and run all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with the follow @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped prior to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current tracks when you are on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your user name . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . to do so , press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the Audio CD in the menu . a file browser will pop up with several folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RE@@ F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically this adju@@ sts the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece exactly like all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata .
developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that cannot be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find annoying . disable the option symbol while playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Set@@ ting Settings ... and select the changes you want .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context browser design , click Create New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc. ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . launch Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok from the drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio Ac@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please check the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine has not compiled these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that will install the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok again .
I have a second sound card and I use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound@@ card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output specify the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio &quot; type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio &quot; type h@@ w card 1 }
in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ mark on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being cared for . of course you can take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you would like , you can become the new so much @-@ needed supervis@@ or for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop items from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection will make it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it under the button of the button . you will find this button on the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the playback button .
the Audio CD function uses the audio cd protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have here various ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed , which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window is a scroll display showing the currently running piece or the currently running stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time for the remaining time of play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , exten@@ sible window .
under the running text display there are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL activates or de@@ activates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set the equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control , and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box equ@@ ali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that there is in no other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users is powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser shows different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser @-@ designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they represent information about the current piece in each different aspects .
if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information displayed there has now been distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context @-@ browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you find the favourite pieces of this performer . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on any pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
in the text below , the downloaded text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using the scripts themselves . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok will try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is still running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division is made according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list of different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and including by artist .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing as desired .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you have something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
there is a search filter directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter there is a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . there are various time windows available , ranging from the last 24 hours to one year . you can also select your overall collection , whereby the filter is practically shut off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on an entry gives you the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to media player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files into the tr@@ ash@@ can ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
picking up list - Chan@@ ges an album marked as a set back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer displayed in different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated performer .
the Play@@ list Browser makes handling of many play@@ lists easy . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces sorted on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in the file music@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files by simple dropping can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : thus , dropped files will be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all of the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the return button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
when you enter OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) are found .
if you want to search for entries containing whit@@ esp@@ ace , then en@@ close the search term with quotes : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example , Rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax versions as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist toolbar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add to the playlist . to the right , you will find Play@@ list , Emp@@ ty Play@@ list , and Rand@@ om Mixer .
next , follow the Un@@ do and Rest@@ ore buttons . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , larger Analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button on the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one that you see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Configuration .
there are many other available buttons for the toolbar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars there .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the Status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist .
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry hi@@ des a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue a number appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
the management of the queue allows you to open a queue management tool . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ determined ( details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random items from your entire collection and adds other random items while playing .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio Ac@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the desired playlist , drag it into the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced with the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist &apos;s recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece to your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New popul@@ ates the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random items from each of the play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by running the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts to install on script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button to get more scripts .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section Write of Script .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ encoding , you will get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created by a loss@@ less format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project to do so .
in this dialog box you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog which looks like this :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to write the data .

the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b web site is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback from the forums and get some news on community help .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you will need at least 1 k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also offers &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore , &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ or@@ - and En@@ co@@ der modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co

trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super Video CDs .
Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the software you need to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filen@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folders and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changing . also , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what is to happen , as if you would have called for each project file close .
closes all open projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you have accessed a file .
if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the media . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? -@@ remedy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
open the CD copying dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you can then burn some@@ time later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn some@@ time later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . the converting / reduction of a DVD by means of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the firing button .
a previously lit DVD video can be converted . this dialog box will usually appear after reading a DVD in the contents view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and for cutting black edges .
displays information about the submitted medium . this information is displayed in the contents view and contain the properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Table of Cont@@ ents allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar does not have any actual function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can change the allocation of the keyboard further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when the wizard is started .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task are crucial to which the included programs give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all have common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f curr@@ ent@@ Project ( ) void format@@ ted ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can generate a project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used for data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be recorded audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders which enco@@ de these WAV files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default . other enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything by yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer provides a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to circum@@ vent the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting @-@ up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand for the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the step by step example there are more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the creation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup di@@ alogs - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . note that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pic@@ s ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for alig@@ ning the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG recording devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see the &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approx . 5.5 . always requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate of about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all tracks of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car oster@@ parks . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or retri@@ eved by the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoder program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keywords when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / input the information , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of Pi@@ ec@@ es &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from being har@@ med by the &amp; CD ; any information that is publicly available on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b you can use another ( fake ) address as the system set up . in this type of configuration , so it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; set up for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirrors for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD ; to save wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; if you want to know more about it , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet .
to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the enco@@ ders package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the predefined enco@@ ders . further information on enco@@ ders is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher enco@@ ders .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading real on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate pack@@ et for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; anything that is probably done only once , and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each issuing &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program using fre@@ ed@@ b to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
/ dev / c@@ drom is often a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card holder General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here you can define an additional conversion . in our example everything is left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card file CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second sel@@ ector is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , begins immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , note that if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database beforehand . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both are equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously reading pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you click this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something yourself with the wa@@ v files .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average between 224 and 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : for a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can attempt to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD . if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is written . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each issuing &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those for one &amp; CD ; with successfully logged data . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than fetch it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just like in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , consult the questions and answers section of the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD .
if you do not select the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; in accordance with the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; input field , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the Comment field of the album can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successfully retri@@ eving the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album names ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this option is set up on the Basic Settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . look to the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ off CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t provide the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked in this way are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece in or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the selection Sel@@ ection of the selection process , so this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you see this error message if you attempt to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in the case of weak machines , the result is unclear . the computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; today is maintained within the c@@ de ; CVS is part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still to read ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of program start ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; may it do . at least after making contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; and k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; can drag and drop windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards for storing text in MIDI files ( real @-@ time events or tex@@ tual events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesi@@ zers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file of one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button on the toolbar , select the Ab@@ play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once a piece is played , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and driving with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and so change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure applied to the space bar like printing on the button pause or selecting the menu item break in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again both . some pieces don &apos;t have any lyrics at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . so if you want to enable automatic text selection in the Settings menu , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the It@@ iner@@ aries or Property List@@ ings from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the selected items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you need to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection while opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if Automatic Add to Collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied while opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click on Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select collections from the sub@@ menu Ab@@ play@@ er@@ order of the Coll@@ ections menu , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry For@@ Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are non @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map compil@@ es general MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type change patch to j@@ ump@@ et and always lets a trumpet sound when playing a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required translations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
this section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order , and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example doesn &apos;t support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do so , use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( bul@@ let shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , in which each note is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped to a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used above all to make sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . see for example the provided keyboard maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio is given in which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . therefore , if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent a decim@@ al point in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM says that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are trying to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave up . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you will see which tones are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and a good syn@@ thesizer gives you a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately .
accept , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
do not forget to set Automati@@ cally add the collection beforehand . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default speed , double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a MIDI file ) or want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the file to the Windows by &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to your collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ D@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as a hobby I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or an MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group , I will list all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me since I may already have the file .
I have made &amp; k@@ mid ; I wrote completely in my spare time and got money by anyone . I would like to point out that I only want to continue programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks go to Jose L@@ u San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ itch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks are also to all these excellent musicians who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ im@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; it was installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ och@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that only appears when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the permanent playlist category .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can do that only if &amp; S@@ MB ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ MB / , can be changed by an editor , then select from the View menu and select the next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you must select play@@ lists from the menu Remove from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; S@@ MB , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB Player ; note the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ MB / .x@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ MB / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml files . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation on startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog from &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the stream from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ MB . here you can see the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog from &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even be inserted into the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; S@@ MB Player ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ MB Player ; can be used in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device and the TV channels . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ player , the dialog in the settings is under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. PAL for West Europa ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ d in it .
as the V@@ DR support of S@@ MB can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , from KM@@ players for the sources different names are used . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , external source , intro@@ version , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any hint that I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root after installing the device . it is important to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drives to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . among Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ Live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should include the documentation of the distribution / installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the Ki@@ le ; website should be established .
if you have questions about the compilation of &amp; Ki@@ le ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the opportunity to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; also offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; the ability to complete , compile , re@@ work and troubleshooting within the source code as well as conversion and view tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities , read the manual of K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; latex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( eng@@ l lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book on it . to be able to speak properly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex should be used : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just as other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the most general features such as paper format , side number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick entry Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book@@ .com &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; latex ; for the integration they only need to be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is simply a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a gray text on the screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will hear it by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the setting of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu Set@@ ting ; set up the La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful when creating your own . once a DVI ; file &#91; rendered file &#93; was created &#93; , &amp; Ki@@ le jumps ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the ordinary output file of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the return search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element was cli@@ cked into the DVI ; file , the corresponding section is j@@ umped into the &amp; latex ; source search is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; latex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding area in DVI ; -@@ viewer j@@ umped .
master document : this feature is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other involved .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set via project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file on the &quot; n@@ der@@ ungen@@ Â &quot; file becomes superf@@ lu@@ ous , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after quick installation .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for fast structuring of the document into sections , chapters , sections , ...
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes , notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( select a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last field of selection named Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for setting the font size . you can specify the font size for the main text , the notes , etc . the following fonts are available for processing :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and st@@ acking settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12 pt &#93; specifies the font size . if font size is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Building or the Quick Build button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document is out of place , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using Quick Build , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( close environment ) is a text that is handled differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the incorpor@@ ation of the fonts within the environment .
changes are only secured within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold , sive print , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be recur@@ sively displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in the fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl E can be converted back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . its window has to be closed by an external viewer .
once the DVI ; file is created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ atively ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer created . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as needed for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using a file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source code is created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ selected search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this purpose , only Modern under Settings Ki@@ le must be set up ... To@@ oling Building is balanced .
to search for pre @-@ selection , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on for subsequent search . the jump to the corresponding area in the DVI ; viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ tit@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ tit@@ ular ; to be specified as text editor ( Settings ... Editor )
if a mistake is used when using the &amp; DVI ; the viewer does not open , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file explains the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can use the Pre@@ Te@@ X errors and the latest La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumping between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the faulty line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
once you have cli@@ cked on the corresponding button on the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re @-@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
ug@@ ly users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same in@@ tro for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting a file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings box ... Settings can be adjusted .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which character strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering documentary class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps have to be completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default selected template .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template is deleted , search for a template on the Internet and be executed under the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ate ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its features should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all the commands in &amp; latex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that in this way , if you click on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par will be balanced .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source code and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ orders from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jumping marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu @-@ based editing of ho@@ ck marks or the corresponding key coll@@ ars enable the jump to the next or last jump brand . this is also highlighted by this jump brand , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already excellent features offers , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing an &amp; latex ; it always supports many environments and groups , and therefore support &amp; Ki@@ le ; specific commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word below the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also includes &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a return stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit , the following commands are included to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the Edit Sel@@ ection paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le provides ; for more commands under Edit environment for a more simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command j@@ umped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
this command j@@ umped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups defined by { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
this command j@@ umped to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command j@@ umped to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
if the cursor is located before or behind the gra@@ ded par@@ enth@@ esis of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the group jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group cl@@ amps quickly the overview can be lost . this command finally completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used as a substitute for the purpose . for the beneficial implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple notes . also for the end of the application the sign is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and add two closing symbols for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic import of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ r or french ) and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is in a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ates or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close &amp; Ki@@ le within a table setting ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a line termination completes .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings Box ; Set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environment and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to inv@@ ent it . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab on the above line . although this tab is not the added tab , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) still extended . three different modes are installed . all of these modes can be configured for different modes of work under Settings Box ... fully adjustable .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the return key , the last letter of the entry is removed and , as a result , the list of errors can be added . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jumping marks can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of jumps N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jump @-@ mark and the desired parameters can then be retained .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; full settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different types of utilities for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as utilities of the common language used .
the mode command mode is not useful for complete environments . it is always possible to enter a few letters with \ \ begin and the call to complete mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the full @-@ loss mode over the menu work@@ around or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient order can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le , real@@ ises that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .
setting Ki@@ le ; setting up ... Ki@@ le ; full settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the wi@@ per list of the full @-@ loss mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of lines that can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be fully furnished . as an example of an extraction list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , where for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated via the menu editing or the key r@@ g + alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large utilities are not helpful for automatic complete completion . however , it has been found that many offices are written more than once in a document . with this , &amp; Ki@@ le offers ; the completion of all already written words .
this mode can be set up in the menu Set@@ ting ... Ki@@ le can be disabled completely . here , the threshold value for the display of complete damage can also be specified .
the support files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( default ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . in view of the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be kept and taken into account .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed into the menus to create comp@@ iling , comp@@ iling and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used as keyboard alto ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer by Alt ; 3 ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be added to the Project &apos;s New Project .... The following information is qu@@ eri@@ ed for the project :
when exec@@ uting the filen@@ ame , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to run EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can change in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le has a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system where basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages it contains and another &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; instructions included and is therefore ideal for searching for specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extra@@ di@@ ted , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application text doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the to &amp; Ki@@ le ; provided documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source editor , which can be installed on all systems with &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; C@@ de ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X can be dri@@ lled .

everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how superior it is . if we raise it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer need to rely on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application needs an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in a ge@@ aring working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time you start my@@ pro@@ c .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a display on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick on current file and select the file to be scann@@ ed by other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check option .
to use an &amp; DT@@ D file , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; using Defini@@ tions @-@ UR@@ I ; &amp; XML ; Schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is specifying the Defini@@ tions @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .

the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start editing the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project involves several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
a member can have several roles within the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for more information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that inv@@ okes a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
event Configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the add@@ res@@ see list . the recipient can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes can be entered easily . either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment field , followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax is @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the team member &apos;s nick@@ name .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over a number of pages that are handled in succession .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion , can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal Gross / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : upper@@ case / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attribute . normal Gross / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; added .
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
automatic update : when switched on , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : types of mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in a different way as file opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is ex@@ tin@@ ct from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies regularly so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface has been changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ ading / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by means of hooks of non @-@ poll@@ s .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in divided mode . regarding the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set into details .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings area , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the update frequency of the tree by editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be automatically opened . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
the area for setting short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) that can be un@@ folded when editing a larger text . short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause short@@ cut means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be stated :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin when you start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in read @-@ only mode : check if the plugin refuses to load it . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , you can choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a debu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin Sel@@ ection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view where the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view where the output ( like in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to debu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it does not have to be respected .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a debu@@ gging request has been started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a debu@@ gging requirement is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the debu@@ gger guides the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include is corrected .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there was not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how to blend &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic templates of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a typ@@ ing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bearing the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags to describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
prints the source code used for filling in the Tag Editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
sets the attribute text position within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . at present , the check is performed only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filen@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it , achiev@@ able via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a list selectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action to create the same dialog :
the short@@ cut identified by this action . clicking the User Language button can be used to assign a keyboard short@@ cut ; K@@ einer can be used to remove the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although skilled paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir parameter in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This method tries to find the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be received in the standard input . in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted according to the input . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error messages . it can be specified what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value sel@@ ector output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the pop@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan to use it , activate &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog if available so that input can be entered while using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that better represents the action , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Diagra@@ m Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; by default uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does , but also for all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually released as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ Tag in the current document is inserted .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags as there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to tool bar , or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool bar to set up dialog on Settings toolbar . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by mastur@@ b@@ ating all symbols to make sure everything works .
back up to the correct folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder . please adjust its &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; - Language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . the first part will be left to you , we will treat the second one here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top item = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = func@@ q@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see the following documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of doc@@ r@@ c file which is used to design context sensitive help . for example , when writing an &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file easily , after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the disk resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places , there is an Email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send to the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where any other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . contributions will be checked and only available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a contribution , we recommend signing the resources for which it uses a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and clicking OK will start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , the toolbar of the toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , expl@@ ores &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that is to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that should appear in the ! doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; adjusted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter seeks to bring them close to them without understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administrators to backup different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which mixes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the tabs with information and tool@@ bars . please hit in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tabs , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area leads to a further context menu concerning the edited document content , such as editing / copying / past@@ ing , editing the text under the mouse poin@@ ter , using the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file when the string under the mouse poin@@ ter calls a file .
at the upper end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the symbol representing the tag . now , you can enter the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open and strip them . in the display with tabs are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the contex@@ tual menu that appears .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It is open to you all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the breakdown in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element a list of commands is opened in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed on project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool bar in an email , you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is in the PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; node ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why development , what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as they need for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details in the details are with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ee Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being removed .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Description , so they appear correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
to@@ ggles the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script returns error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debu@@ gger .
removal and switching on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the location of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
attitudes like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project administr@@ ates . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
load a project toolbar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . actions need to be added by Settings . actions must be saved using Tool@@ bar Settings ... or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team to make the toolbar available for the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
enables up@@ loading tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load an &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activates or de@@ activates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar den@@ ies when this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the Plugins menu the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above menu items . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
select the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the switch can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended to use the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar , or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help in accordance with the context of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information panels can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ err@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default , templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . at server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
allow files to be mounted somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection of OK .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the check@@ box , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles , or changed using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
this means that the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be configured with the Options button .
up@@ loading profiles can be set in the sub@@ window profiles as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by creating its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the event configuration window , event actions can be turned on and these actions can be added , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced at the moment .
to open a different project , select Open Project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar . the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing with ... in the context menu that can be accessed with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the main memory and forgotten by program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password saved on the disk -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the server name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
as already mentioned above are toolbar elements in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best is to be sty@@ led by the tool toolbar . using and adding differ . adding tool bar is treated at the bottom of the Adding of Tool@@ bar .
the toolbar and symbols on it can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which with New Action , a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be removed , toolbar can be renamed or toolbar adjusted , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will additionally be removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and Settings can be set .
templates are basically a document skel@@ eton , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use templates basically like a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before using .
binary is anything that is not pure text . it can be binary files except text , images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually added in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As local template ....
once this has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save choice as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or insert over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and select a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can specify he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically combine with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , click the folder in the template table with the right mouse button and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a sel@@ ector with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led once par@@ ental attributes are ti@@ pped .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set to default , it would automatically disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably are in a root folder .
allows pre@@ text or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and can be used by copying contents to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already using the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to it , right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to source code editor if necessary , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ absence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; in order to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 activates this mode , the key press moves the active cursor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta . by choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatic . in principle , the time interval can be set automatically . basically the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow .
let &apos;s assume that you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information on the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords in column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
it is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . in rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the selection functions as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using the return key or the removal key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way on the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed every other anchor tag .
some toolbar buttons such as the tables wizard or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other styles for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , only need the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries , which are already available with a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed attachment points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path . filen@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g working folder is for example a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ do@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following entry is possible :
this command checks for a partial or entire agreement with a template named QNA@@ ME or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any of the my@@ ME that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file ; x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is performed automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stop points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with the Re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can scroll through the arrow keys and scroll down the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass set expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; ble@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no clu@@ es to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; differences within a line and changes to white characters represented . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is also fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; while automatically selecting the correct changes . the merge editor among the differences windows allows you to edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; c@@ logged ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anger when someone alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :

the Open dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog will re@@ mark your selection and display it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
via the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is introduced . however , if a file is selected for A , for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison begins immediately . in the open dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it above a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can not remove anything from &amp; c@@ logged ; only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for this is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see .
if differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not as important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( under the reference windows ) also has an Info line with the output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , the automatic merge already contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the skip to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
when only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes , no more line is left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or by editing ; then this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark you might copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the options ignore the options or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , down , side up , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
you can also use the other buttons to edit in the display window . with the insert button you can switch between insert mode and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns syn@@ cs the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation that you can jump to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous distinction ( C@@ trl @-@ bottom / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ image upward ) or the next / previous conflict . therefore , conflicts must be distinguished between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is checked , whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is not necessary . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ ride the clip@@ board contents .
line end@@ ings are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end@@ ings of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when returning and restored at the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered sc@@ ast@@ ly . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ just color .
when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual to the clip@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; c@@ logged ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step will not ignore each line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignore &amp; c@@ differ ; the carriage return character is made visible , but like a white character . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . as a result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complex and large files , but slow in very large files .
in automatic mode this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before continuing to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically solves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need time @-@ to @-@ use , then use the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation on directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to termin@@ ate &amp; diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the code for coding appears a brief description of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded cap@@ tion column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed in addition to the normal yet another cap@@ tion column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply fill out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
classi@@ fies the comparison window side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . merge current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default file name . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to that external command . in &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is handed over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line operations to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a super@@ l@@ ative expression that matches every character string . the \ \ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in upper@@ case . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line breaks suitable . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / sub@@ stitution / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations will only change the data that the line @-@ like algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders with &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
when you read the folders , a small news window informs you about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded down . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to fold all sub @-@ directories and open all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the Name column in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed again about problems of this type .
as seen in the picture above , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black are used .
for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries varies .
folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option synchron@@ izes directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
when two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ safe ) then expl@@ ores &amp; c@@ logged ; the date of the files and performs the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the same date is identical , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . the Status column shows D@@ ept when the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a last check and see if the status is okay everywhere .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) or all entries at once . once you have selected all Mer@@ ger actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you haven &apos;t specified a destination folder , C will be used as the target in the three @-@ folder merge mode , B will be chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to select only the current entry , select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulations and Cancel .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , you can restart / resume directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; hit an error , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge operation ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged , &amp; c@@ logged ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them later . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is turned off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and brow@@ sed recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to yourself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed benefit will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are the same size . for example , this can be useful if the modification date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option can be turned off in default .
enable synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file , it will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not just the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder mer@@ ging view stays visible during mer@@ ging single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can disable the Directory &amp; Text window option in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do so , use the current file mer@@ ging from the merge menu .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open to local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permission or modification date . therefore , the permissions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In@@ sert in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally required &amp; c@@ Diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then dec@@ lines &amp; c diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is called Com@@ pare ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I use GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or are going to go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. c@@ Diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines disappear to each other , this is the purpose of this is often the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra file format that could save this information .
the effort required was so far too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor .
after removal of text suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; published and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
in order to be able to use all functions of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , you need to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .

a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
da &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have trouble comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function after modifications to these options . )
only entries are displayed that show differences . this also means that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C label below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( e.g. &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
the middle mouse button allows windows to be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty Back@@ ground by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and exit . however , if an application is cli@@ cked inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , View Desktop and Exec@@ ute . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this box is checked , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
check@@ points this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this box is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ;
when this box is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the actual program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with their content .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and select setting up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . If you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to this one value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can enlarge a part of the screen as if you read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact amount of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; k@@ mag ; a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called the magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged portion of the screen and is referred to as the selection box below .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to do so , set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor on the screen edge ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use it , you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the CPU time needed to go to 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; use a range of screen to enlarge as if you would use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse @-@ click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , even through the use of your computer , pain can also be caused . if you suffer from pain that is related to your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by mouse click , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse @-@ click away as soon as you inter@@ rupt the motion .
the intelligent move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button emul@@ ating . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if the mouse is switched on , the shutter speed is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving is done in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse @-@ shift . is this function activated , generates a slow move to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow move to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; you can move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is checked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any startup of &amp; node ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings are reset to the status after the last pressing of Apply .
the best thing is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent move should be turned off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first , you should be aware at which places there is a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not present a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually rather simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
when you have removed the ball you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or a f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a move . if you are using the intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , an accidental mouse click can cause un@@ desired reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible in this way to select text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice about this :
do not use the smart move if you are just starting &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , mark text as follows : drag a mouse @-@ click at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shifting time begins when it is intelligent . however , you can also use the intelligent move without the mouse click . but this requires some practice .
um &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . that should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clip is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is slow@@ ing down . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and inflic@@ ting pain on the patient .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping can also be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets dum@@ b users speak their computers for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course pro@@ positions that are to be talked about again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without typ@@ ing them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have started mouth , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the c@@ aching memory . you can select sets that should be discussed again .
with the Settings menu entry , mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger as well as the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the Language Output box , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field you specify the character encoding with which text is passed to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your voice generator . examples of this are found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using kt@@ es@@ d as a speech service is to be used as a speech service and mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ach@@ d speech service is a standard interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first select field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by short@@ cuts or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage directory or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant performer , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the Ver@@ sions storage . with the selection of Add to the input field , the chosen text passage is entered only in the input field .
with the second selection box , close the editing window for text pass@@ code , you can specify whether the text message directory should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ wor@@ d@@ book will not be saved . select before Save , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word @-@ extension . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this sel@@ ector , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
using the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the short@@ cut key . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected area of the processor .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected area of the processor .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the process memory .
when this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text pas@@ sage@@ ways with entries . by default , the bar is placed above the editing window directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open settings , mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the speech output on the card speech output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers for more details . )
the Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without further dis@@ semination .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett directory . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled to send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA have been installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as speech service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to set up , use the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ TT@@ SD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be successful , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot talk can output text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re @-@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

before you can use , you must install and set up program speech dis@@ pat@@ chers . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card holder is shown . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card holder will be shown in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ops . otherwise , the program speed Dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spo@@ k@@ m@@ gr &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the card holder will be displayed . this will appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not pres@@ et a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a female and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card holder . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; almost use it . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; click on the assignments to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language delivery system . click the General tab in the General tab to open the card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the kt@@ ops ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create text orders and let them read . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ IP ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar while reading , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start , stop , pause and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for one job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the ticket orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can let the text of the displayed website read . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ops . then select the text that should be read and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can let the displayed text read . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ops . then check the text that should be read and select Tools Text in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you about events you set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; for example set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with kt@@ ops , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
filter for character set composition offers a good way to correct in &amp; kt@@ ops ; incorrect stressed or incorrect spoken messages . it removes tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be assumed to be assumed in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of kt@@ ops ; for normal work with kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in filters text is processed before being sent to the program speech dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and will hold these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you read &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . any order you receive from the card is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such read , this issue is stopped and finished .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters work on the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
drawing replaces parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will be delivered with predefined string filter filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re@@ format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery by &amp; kt@@ ops ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with voice selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops . if you have set a female voice on the card holder for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a notice is sent to &amp; kt@@ ops , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be processed in line up from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed below .
for the establishment of string enforcement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the respective replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to be distinguished by the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ ase column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file that app@@ ends the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application id running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID number @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you are allowed to enter only copied .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box This filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . however , if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package name .
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program must be installed on your system .
set the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker sel@@ ector filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card holder or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program dict@@ ates , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card board . by using the speaker sel@@ ector filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to receive help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions listed above , the speaker is selected , which meets the requirements most likely . click on the button on the right to see the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box This filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; allows programmers to give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the Language Output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both APIs is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

text of text to preview and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start t@@ t@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read .
due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you have to do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just oc@@ cured . what can I do against it ?
first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string reduction filter .

the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers used by &amp; kt@@ ops have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a separate license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the c@@ de@@ accessibility package from it . &amp; kt@@ ops ; find the source code of c@@ de@@ accessibility ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the website htt@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of languages listed above can be incomplete or out of date . therefore , consult the description of the Syn@@ thesi@@ zers to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ops ; for information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you would like to extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need an up @-@ to @-@ date development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ chers . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source text archive for c@@ de@@ accessibility or downloaded the tar@@ ball every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ops , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ ops that uses the program speech dispens@@ er . the t@@ ms@@ gr program should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into single phrases . the user can return set or paragraph styles , let them repeat , stop or cancel the issue .
if an application displays text on &amp; kt@@ ops , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be selected automatically . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; select a speaker , look in .
if you click Add Spo@@ k@@ es@@ person on Add , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card holder is displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text to be passed to the festival . if you have voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops are known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a certain knob and display this grey , the voice you have chosen doesn &apos;t allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster ( with larger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker yet ( or click Apply to Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of kt@@ th m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and t@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are performed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card holder .
with the buttons in this series you can go ahead or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on the OK button all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ th m@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to preview the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card . see also .

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works for you . in doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this card you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language instruction :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and will hold these orders . once the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that reads messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone greet someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the incoming message .
the settings on this card are valid for normal text orders only . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; to read K@@ No@@ tify messages , run kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card card noti@@ fications will appear .

if this setting is checked , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ops ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . also , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of voice codes . SS@@ ML is part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British mascul@@ ine ) since this is the default voice that uses the Festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or key in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ p@@ s. % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single phrases . this allows &amp; kt@@ ops to begin quickly , since only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ised , not the whole text order .
here you see the set level detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set @-@ level detection filter is set automatically as a default . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ level detection filters , but beginners will not be advised .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by selecting . turn off the speaker selection and enter text for reading . check the selection of speakers , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster with pre @-@ reading , because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which may take a long time ,
you can then pause or cancel your text orders on the card map , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set level detection filters compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set @-@ level recognition filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ level detection filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ops .
you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the card board . the card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card holder ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , showing all characteristics of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker most likely matches the originally set characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired subscri@@ ber here . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property will take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a specific application will send text in a different language than the language set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case , there is 0 for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ th m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get any trac@@ eability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ops ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) website at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ th m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ es@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals . as a guide you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be trac@@ ed through the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card board for speaker setup . depending on the selected voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the Spe@@ aking Speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ converter filter , and set up the Spe@@ aker Speed .
I don &apos;t like websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file th@@ rows the GEN@@ DER tags to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string reduction filter and now I can start in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no longer set @-@ up or go back . orders are displayed on the tab jobs , the job consists of only one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , call@@ sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) should not be filtered out . instead , use a filter for set @-@ level detection for these characters .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . for this , please refer to the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to let websites read , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language delivery system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation a new module will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be fully installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ This tool actually displays and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to select which corresponds best to the distribution and the rel@@ ap@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting non @-@ recurring questions the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button to set up the device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to view the dialog with more options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so there is no further setting required . in the selection list either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the choice of manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask is set .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . switching on an off @-@ off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specifies the IP address of the host on the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry and down@@ gra@@ ding or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the drop down or down button in the priority list .
by clicking the Add button ... a group of hosts for name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will add the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
select one entry from the group calcul@@ ator and then click the Edit .... button to view the Edit dialog .
the name @-@ known calcul@@ ator specifies the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list of names known to name contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP is still in the test to replace version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known machine and press the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named machine from the list and select Edit .... The Modi@@ fied Calcul@@ ator dialog will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical user interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second one is discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf ; utable configuration files .
this area cannot replace more extensive knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never found great distribution . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future , so this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the spread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the point of contact that runs a valid IP address or , if available , can be used DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be arbitr@@ arily selected !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility of storing multiple archives on a tape . the development of &amp; k@@ dat ; carried out with two goals . the first was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife posed : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat , which can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; R@@ ST the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat , don &apos;t recognize the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat , the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ generated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape , indicates that the integration for the tape has been solved and indicates a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without risk .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band @-@ type must be format@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat , . if your tape drive requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before using it , this must happen before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . floppy @-@ tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , whereas DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity &amp; k@@ dat , continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost . after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Testing ....
once the scan process has been started , the dialog box appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the verification settings , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can re@@ establish the restore , the files that are to be restored need to be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check@@ mark . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the File menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will pop up for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be found separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then have been saved .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the button files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
this setting is active , conve@@ ys &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is mounted the command mt load on the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is automatically e@@ ject . do not use this option for floppy disks .
is the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ side block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat , in any case tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this icon is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to provide quick access , for example , to information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of specific programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among others :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions that can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log tries to open the system log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will not show you , and it will open rather than a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely you do not have permission to read under Linux normally in the / var / log file , for normal users .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or after input strings . in addition , enter a string into the filter bar . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only the log lines are displayed that will be shown for the selected filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if the filter search term string is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , also select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the Protocol file system log , select the process column , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as the protocol lines of the level indicator . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can show the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the Add to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new entry lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather familiar ( and also named as ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling program start @-@ up at boot of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you would like to start when you run the system or switch to another runtime . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services don &apos;t contain such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something on startup , which has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ time is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ set Run@@ time 3 is . if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you will be able to repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from the command line like this :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that can run only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user @-@ run level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; start .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the field of Available Systems Services to one of the six Run@@ time to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ time ( or position ) . this only happens if they pull out an entry from the realm of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you need to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to recover items that have been thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run level , move it to the clip@@ board by cutting it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired Run@@ time with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sort number or name of an entry , press the Enter key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu call for confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ways , and now the machine starts to boot constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed to run under Run@@ time X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or configured in@@ correctly .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual .
this documentation relates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save button in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group features .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled user settings ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card box will be created on which you can make individual settings . other cards may appear , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Unix .
the password management board map appears , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD applications .
this card box only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limitations of space each in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with space limitation with the help of the file system .
the Groups tab informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ur Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features include a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO bo@@ oting manager , add , remove and change boot password , change time to boot from the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
