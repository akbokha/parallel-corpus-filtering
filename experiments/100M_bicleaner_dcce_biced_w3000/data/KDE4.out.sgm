<seg id="1">The module webpage can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras webpage. from the drop-down list, select the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert text to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; select Setup Wizard... Open the card map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the node; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Tools &gt; Accelerate. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; or the list of crashes, if any, erase.</seg>
<seg id="11">The view filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; s current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the ad starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree-maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and label settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap display algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of the entries, and this framework will need space, which is then lost to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">The implementation of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum area for an entry on the menu item View Announcement with Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you call the module picture gallery, a dialog box opens which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotary field to set the number of thumbnails each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">By displaying the file name of the image you determine if the file names are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">Display the file size of the image to see if the file size is displayed in the gallery in the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the check box image size, you can determine if the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder check box, you can set with a slider or a lathe to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original images with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment field check box, you can use a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Individual color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings offers easy access to the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Tools HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under the navigation pane or with the F9 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser detection changes a menu entry in the & konqueror; in addition to which you can change the browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change your browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse to access browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to run with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are correctly represented by the identifier of this obsolete browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module review your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You can check the website's website in the & konqueror; menu under Extras webpage. you can perform the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check if your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; matches, all found bugs are displayed. with this test you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; -document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your site for further instructions and faulty shortcuts. recursively all links to the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for the verification of your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; -style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module web archiving for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .pdf format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on Tools web page with the mouse and a dialog box appears to save the displayed website.</seg>
<seg id="54">The module Web-Archives is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpbch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and directly download your photos. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; includes quick image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded using KDE Image Plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitised; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">As all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitised; tries to report problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests... This opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these shortcuts, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all the information you need is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitized; is a project supported by a community. that is, users and developers help each other. if you are a regular user by & digikam; if you are a regular user of & digikam; you can ask questions here to other users of & digikam; however, English is spoken in this mailing list, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digitifs; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. guidance to report in the developer mailing list from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you are editing & digitised; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data store is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like. & digicode; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder containing pictures as the base folder. & digicam; considers any subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitised; durst recursively recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders, unless it iste in hidden folder. this allows you to do extra & digitised; complete a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon. this will then be used as a album symbol. for more details, see the albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up and digitize your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Samples to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw File Support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digicam; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderProgramming and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and directly download your photos. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is then used as disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever-increasing number of over 800 cameras. photo Transfer Protocol, a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association, allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to read the thumbnails from digicam. the Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitised;, KPhotos Album, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digitised; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digitised; even perform itself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree tree, above the horizontal dividing line or another application window. the only limitation is that a picture can't be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to make the most popular: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter will only be used for the fields currently displayed in the toolbar. this will only show the filtering on the file name if it is displayed as a symbol view. which fields can be displayed can be configured in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos managed by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. to do so, select Import Pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the destination album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select Edit Folder Properties from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos when you want to add or delete albums from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, new: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. for this purpose, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first image of the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and drop in the context menu & quot; As album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the picture window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait briefly while the thumbnails are generated. this allows you to avoid using all the thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the preview. what information these are can be edited by digitised; set up the Albums tab here and adjust the preview images to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse-cursor leave a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can view all the functions with & digikam; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and selecting Edit.... in the Edit section; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with image editing you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need does not provide. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. to this, and how to customize it to your needs, see & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing by other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the picture. some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for turning. the easiest way is to right-click on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want a photo from & digikam; erase, it is moved to the garbage bins of & kde; move F8 Image Delete or Del if you want to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslider quot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keywordquot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported at the loss of the database as soon as & digikam; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you click on a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting keywords in the context menu. you can change the keyword name and icon in the tree & quot; My Key.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and put it in the context menu As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To handle all the functionality with keywords, first you need to add keywords. this can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword, you can also click on the keyword in the tree & quot; My Key. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select cue points from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords attached to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear in the main window under preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you open the context menu of the photo using the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame you just need to click the lower rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit. this displays all the corresponding images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp the green will find when searching find matches. if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again. if the search did not find anything then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs inside the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you entered as search criterion. after you have saved it appeared filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your choice, press OK and the search will be executed. the results will be displayed in the View My Search List in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search List and select an option from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you choose to edit your search, the form to input the search will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you choose to edit as extended search, the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">In case you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu Search.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields by & digiplug; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group added or deleted from it. any option can be added to this list using the Logical Operations All..., One..., None... or at least.... furthermore, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NECHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this enables images to compare by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one. by means of a swelless, the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the matching pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out or hold it. move it while you hit the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this of course presupposes that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digiplug; provides a lighting table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the lighting table from the context menu. the selection is added to the illuminated table and its window opened. if you are back in & digitised; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronize the preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the images, you can also compare the same range of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you are using pairing from the toolbar, the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for loading. now, use the left mouse button on any preview image to view it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lighting table such as F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can spot on the crossed arrows. in order to pivot the visible area of the picture, you need to click on it and hold the & LMB; in mode preview, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out. this happens in both images when you are in the mode preview.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to secure, find, protect and use photos again. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that digitized; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, archiving, optimizing, waiting and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, assembles, manufactures and exports content that has a monetary or cultural asset. "</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no longer a certain photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digitised;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you maintain anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% of work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies securing strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the file's settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item from the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change them? to do so, & digicam; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should assign words, captions and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next job.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, such as many other programs, or continue to categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically insert the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digicam; updated while the subtree is tracked.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata overlaps. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone else just see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'll tell you that this is the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming of having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer, to help him understand what you are moving about.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images. KDE even provides a spell checker. you do not have to tell the story any second time for the illustration and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical details. & digicam; can also export kml files that you export with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information about the editing page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be like: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a comment on the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who uses the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organisations can be listed here, which you offer the image to others. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright-sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator can delete or modify them in the picture. for individuals this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitized; in the near future, it will provide such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: panel error, plate failure, power shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. this section is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics which cause data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must be handled carefully and you can't trust them for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you are just written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the checksums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; however, it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. after that, read the data back to verify you. likewise, you should mark the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and in front of animals. do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer warrants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives available on this subject:</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in case of lower temperature, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure, SMART cannot determine this error. this is in particular read errors and publishing counter. the expected life time amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't make a lot of power, this can cause heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these anomalies can cause serious damage to your computer. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it complies with the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also have a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to store your data and run down the system. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its safety in case of current problems with the costs of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20%, A 500W UPS you can get for less than & euro; 40. at the end, you should always remember how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed into photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version will provide you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs secure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these disruptions remain undetected until one day there should be no protection for it. nobody seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than the one on your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a lower level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard compatibel. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss for notebooks and 46% for workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the proportion of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the broadest file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limitations. this means that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. therefore, secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will have you lucky if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget about aeronautics: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, to the neighbour house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete Backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes with a compression system next with the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you have enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come out for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file associated IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To enable valuable images to survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature you need to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualisation is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually always means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have included the scalability and the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and relocate to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new record was recognized by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # functions with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software exists that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG can be used as an open source standard, but it can much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that it has relative lot of administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. we would like to recommend this format to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format is adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed because of the need to unify the camera ear formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provides DNG and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource blocking & technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive their image, mostly in raw format, to archive them. however, XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, the raw format can be switched. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered processing you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digicam; edit, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the Adding a Photos to an Album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use it, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn on it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the camera will be displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturer's notice, GPS etc of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the default selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and download Selected. the selected button will be grayed as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not yet been edited by & digikam; in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, of course, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the All Download or download buttons, a dialog box appears to select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown, like normal folders. you can read details on the folder sorting in the section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digicam; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete the deleted ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. the photos will not be moved into the garbage bins of & kde; so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera reader, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the file names are usually reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder is created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the Standard Auto Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format than the standard format, for example, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-%% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. to do so, turn off the date & time option. for more customizations, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase. or uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digikam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to enable automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Metadata, you can read more about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digicam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digicam; this uses to automatically upload sub-albums in the target album. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras make this information available. in the section sidebar Meta data, you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in that case it saves & digicode; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the date-based lower at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download the button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask & digiplug; you, where the images should be uploaded. a folder selector dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it may be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can click on a browser to display the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, semitrailing and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual input of known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few working with GPS receivers to work together. either as a map module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in the gpx format since this is the only format supported by the module for geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There exist various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of pictures and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the delimited coordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; try to give you as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that have the behavior of Edit digikam; you need to select set up. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to a saved preview or start image editing. so you set the default behavior of & digitised; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the photographer's job title. this can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the image that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of another & quot;. if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fields. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database from & digikam. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & digitised; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labeling as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other picture viewers. attention: for images that already contain captions, they are overwritten by the edited notes.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitibles; to specify which file types & digicode, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions, from & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The panel settings are set to the default values. each time you open the illuminated table these settings can be turned on when possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; if you have one then you can obtain better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you are using image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance density than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression option you can reduce the size of .png files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option compress TIFF files, you can turn on the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on the image quality since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting Lossless JPEG-2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam; image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">When you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option shows the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that undersupplied images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-lights, so the parts of your images that are burned into it, because of the inability of your camera to capture the top lights in the settings. the setting colors will trigger some unusual results since it shows the pointed lights in various pink tones. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcrap therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the reconstruct option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the Edit & Edit page. to keep the time for the demo small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that come from the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. however, as if AHD interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity-direction) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction as it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from one color space to the other is to be translated in order for the colors to be as exact as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior issues when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC Profiles You have the option & quot; standard squot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera creators and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color-mapping or gammacorrection. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image of a device would be returned. this is very useful before you print image, as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of getting on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for. unfortunately not with models from Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that you want to use and these are then uploaded by & digicam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings brief commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules, you can get through the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand side show a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. below are the port settings. currently, here are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / more, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out whether & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; View images in the trash bin, you can set the Dialogue of & Edit; when deleting a photo in an album, you will find more details in the deleting a photos and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly done by & digicam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without using any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also make the display of the welcome screen from & digicam; to stop when starting. this will, in some circumstances, accelerate the boot process from & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Searching for new photos will force & digicam; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam; if something is deleted from the base folder, & digicam; you, if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & Edit; used to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digitised; to create, find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitised; includes quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting Edit / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitized. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting up the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, zoom factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or button The Restore image processing button in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by choosing Edit Repeat or Restore by selecting Edit Reproduction from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should use the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; on the toolbar or Restore button on the toolbar for a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current picture, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button on the toolbar: select Enlarger Factor Automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you are using the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change it in the Settings dialog from & Edit. you can view it from the Edit Pane; main window. see the section to set up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can choose to print in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select Export wizard from the Album View menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitised; main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field of Urgency. the code follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box that previously appeared in this & digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification when typing keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all tags of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their Album, - Date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is shown. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog box appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the example above, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is written on no words, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and find that it should be one or two, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I was mainly adapting it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable departure from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make sure to make informed decisions about color management. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions in order to obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by email or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to register my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to calligate your monitor, since sRGB means that your monitor is calibrated by sRGB. if you are working as a colour space of sRGB, then you must either calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Correct Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Compensating: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light limits and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enhance contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a reallocation of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because there is a color space of 8-bit per color. if you can run too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in well-lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. shadow calibration allows you to improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and recharge it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button restores all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computational time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find in the menu under colors tonality correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use these for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; the colour effects tool provides you with four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar polarization, also called Sabatier, was an effect created by using a partial pressure of a short flash light and afterwards complete the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photographic paper inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar polarization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately produces a negative picture that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar efficiency factor. the original image is the (1) and the (2) applied. the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia's highly saturated colors are also a few photocographs, especially those of which hardly agree to landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in case of large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photo. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your Justifications can be previewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can carry out can be previewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">The tool tone correction is located between the complex tool Gradation and the simple denial / contrast / gamma. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the sliders for the application purpose explained here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. below the graph are three sliders that can be clicked in and shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically using the image's settings. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear representation is often the most useful. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: this button automatically sets the image values depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and Sonnentöne. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and no effect is seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left hand side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">A modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode further helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example, the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and darker the corresponding image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is displayed on the preview of the original photo. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you are found in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and no effect is seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Edit & Edit Channels Mixer; image processing is a tool to enhance color channels or change the color hues of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first clue how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the destination image has a red marker. if you position this in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: control for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you need to retain luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as well as you enable the Monochrome option, as the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate superb black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the farmed. it consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and no effect is seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is checked. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves the scenery, maritime scenes and air photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. thus similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">SEpiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of coldness in shading tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiece. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) SEpiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture applying image editing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photograph below. the original picture is (1) and that changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the Edit & Edit; Add tool frame can be added to a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the confines of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. passing the picture with a colored line, Niepce finishes it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), rounded it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any position. this is also possible in several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the Edit & Edit tool you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu applied in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the digiplug; Schablonendatenbank, please send an email in English to the digicam; mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the Folder button in the dialog box. select the folder where you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder will automatically update the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm is taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complex in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without a focus and most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to sum up colors with only minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color pixels are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera has often been used for internal sharpness. in contrast, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a focus filter while scanning the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to use the menu item Correction sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should, however, be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image can refocus the tool. you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to sign softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should be best sharpened in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference. it is therefore possible to define a minimum difference in order to apply for an edge of the filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpening and therefore plastic flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted defaltation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to sharpen a picture to & quot; refocus quot; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocus generally achieves better results than unsharp masking. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'fold. the Gauß' fold has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also depends on the source pixelines that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß 'fold is influenced by the distant pixels, causing undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set higher value if your image is very blurred then pay attention to halo tickets.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. the values are 0.5 and the values are near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will further lubricate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß' sharpness. use this parameter if your inaccuracy is Gauß '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blur masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by causing blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, blurred mask must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied to a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred colour image must be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness of the regulator has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction tool is one of the most advanced tool for removing unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogenous regions and let details sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above allel. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is difficult to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is going to go through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of less than 1 to avoid sub-pixel-smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly. each setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparably very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that was caused by a poor film storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details pane and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter will no longer be able to get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: control edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise or noise peaks may occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the tolerance tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly smoked. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in the luminance density. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and Load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied using standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to sign the softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration process gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are to be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparably very fast at work. however, it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniformity noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious screen capture on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were used to reduce an old colour photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitized; tool Hotpixel allows the hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixel; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defective.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note here that the wizard remembers the last dark image and recharges it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the next pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel Correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shading) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">It also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the iris filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, making it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller as there are otherwise blurring effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and grey grading depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction turns the transformation with a center filter onto a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, reducing the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, set the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitized; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of 4 degrees fixes the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values, tone-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">This value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite delimiter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the size of the image and results in a correction of the first degree. the negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonal or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best result in this correction than first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transforming trimming from image editing or using the Zoom controllers of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the barrel-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of GImpGuru.org web page which is accessible under this URL. the filter replicates the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotmovie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add movie grain when you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitised; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers combine large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy sight, especially in your monochromatic photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and this worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized; Filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitised; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you had chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitised; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3-D effect. it works very well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave Blocks 1: splits the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave Blocks 2: analog to the wavelength 1, the image is distorted along with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: blurred the image along star shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft drawing blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shuttering sharpness: blurred the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and blurbs it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural your images a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of droplets on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the Edit menu to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of a raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools can be found in the menu Transforming Rotating or Transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how you can inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Transform Size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, for example spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photocating was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stemming for photo can be saved as a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by magnifying a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save button under the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview range, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. Ratio knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">After aspect ratio the tool stores its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image sizes are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The context settings help you to make the most of your images together, so that you can better compile your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious pitches are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural patterns of growth, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third-third rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates in this way a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that draws the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals can be placed on these lines more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you take a photo, it's easy to hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle. you can fix this with the Edit & digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation. select Transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown to the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a print to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smooths the picture a bit after the rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically recalculate. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: displays the width of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle at the top right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image gets a little blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shading tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. for example, a horizontal shift will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a right angle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shear your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shear, this effect is usually negligible, but two shuttering produces twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the image has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove it is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitised; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam; edit.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digicam; shows only files in formats that know. this is done by means of file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digicam; the file in the image editing is displayed. you can change this list of file extensions & digitised; please refer to the Configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format pictures to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the configuration section you can find further information on how to use modules with & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digicam; supports loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is included in & digikam. with this, more than 200 raw file formats are supported. all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave Coffin's web page. the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digicam; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. these clips are often stored in the AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built-in capability to view or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digicam; the & kde; settings to play movies use to start the program to play.</seg>

<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphiviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list will open the opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unprocessed graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springspring model for unrealised graphs. it uses the Fruitman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-lattice for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm assigns the nodes in a circular shape according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>

<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same locations at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera pairs need to be recalculated with GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for GPS time and camera pairs. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog box the coordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, choose the region and enlarge it. you can always select the amount manually. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to allow the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. in the area below, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below will show the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option for each picture creates a page creates a gallery where each picture gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg;</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images. to do this, select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLError, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. of course, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails display allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program endings to see if errors during the creation have occurred. the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to carry out basic operations such as twisting, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>

<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodizer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module will use the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a basic image transfer between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be zipped into the MPEG Slideshow. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture will be displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. if possible, keep the extension mpg as close as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you provide an audio file with the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. once you have adjusted all the settings according to your preferences, you can start a coffee with the encoding button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee or enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the button Settings on the bottom right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect the same results as the software from your camera creator. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter Window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion by using the button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the score and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. to do so, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred E-Mail program. it is possible to change the size of the images to be sent earlier. you can drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images to the image selection dialog with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Delete button you will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at one time. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is complete, the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages, searching for errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. by closing this window, you can lock this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Slideshow, a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the option" "" "Show file names" "" "ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used to order the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date still has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments, you can use & kphoto album; Browse through these, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the image, now there are entries in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in the group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments. in addition, there are entries to search for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you hit people with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images appear on which both persons are to be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name. you can with & kphoto album; however, for each person to store your own thumbnail, this is of course also true for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the context menu appears, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual person. to do so, you need to open the image view window (described in detail) and select the category editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can customize the enlargement factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you visit the search in the main window, you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either part of the total file, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here you will see images on which Jesper but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for the photoalbum. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kPhotoAlbum; and take a look at the Quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphoto album; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you start & kphoto album; for the first time launch, or select the menu entry kPhotoAlbum; -Demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphoto album; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the website of & kphoto album; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphoto album; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name already says, this bar displays you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively used in the following ways: you can change the displayed thumbnail view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will see in the preview pane only images of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphoto album; introduces you two options to create html web pages with your pictures. one is in & kphoto album; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphoto album is described; integrated version that you can create from the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and finish. in the following, each area is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphoto album; HTML example pages you will see an example for these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether to create a photo album; export file that is to be seen on the overview page. next information about the export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information appearing to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that & kphoto album; currently all images are exported. you can't use this setting so as to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not download images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, it can scan your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to do this is to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to specify the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages are created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you will have to copy them manually. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have all three related to base folders and URLs. in them, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphoto album; coming together, you may want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to make with & kphoto album; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphoto album; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or whether there is only a link to images in the file. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can share all the images and pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File menu File... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. of course, this is only possible if you have created your .kim file with the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images that you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To copy the manual to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically Copy to the .kim file copy & cphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. however, if you want to do so, simply select the option Export File.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... select, becomes & kphoto album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Import Wizard consists of four steps. first, you need to choose which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you look at images of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend, you may want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps from (1) setting the information about your images, about (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos. in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphoto album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphoto album; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and will automatically reuse it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphoto album; you can also start a different folder tree with pictures, you can & kphoto album; with the -c option. as an example: kphoto album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kPhotoAlbum; set up... get to a window that allows you to change the settings of & kphoto album; in the following section of the user manual we will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access to the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">You can define how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In this section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphoto album; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphoto album; however, most modules possess a help page, which you can call via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are common among each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphoto album; only very little tested. therefore, you should first try out new modules with the demo database before using them using the command &gt; knight album -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphoto album do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphoto album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications put their pictures into albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphoto album; this type of order is not supported, it simulates some modules the order after albums so that you can use the functions with & kphoto album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphoto album; the current album that simply matches the current view, so all the images that show you the preview of the picture at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphoto album, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here you go to the photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphoto album; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category individuals, & kphoto album; so do so, if you would have chosen persons to view the module and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphoto album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen once you start & kphoto album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and tool bar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window that you have entered into your image database. currently, it does not contain a lot of information as you don't have any information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphoto album; is the possibility to mark any picture with comments. this includes information about the persons who are recorded in the picture, where the image has been recorded etc. you can set each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In addition, you can see three lists with a text box by setting people, locations, and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphoto album, because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can so that the used names are moved up, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sort by date icon on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to them. in this case, simply click on the thumbnails and back buttons below the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item to provide multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window showing the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is an overboard, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can also simply drag and drop an entry to a category of this entry. attention, this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... that offers, among other things, the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also omit a frame completely. if you want to get this window shown later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or all images in case you haven't set any filters. you can see an example here. you can configure the thumbnails size by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphoto album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphoto album; namely, use images without having you saved on your hard drive. of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere, so & kphoto album; you can see the view of & kphoto album; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated, are not stored on the hard drive. however, this is available for images 1-9. for the pictures 5-9 however the thumbnails are present, so & kphoto album; however, you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy and paste files from the folders. & kphoto album; it doesn't support you up to now to ask for the CD. so if you're in trouble, how to avoid browsing your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make inaccessible and click on the Current View menu in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister can see, and select the menu entry Everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, so that all images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on one hand, everyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to forbid those who are with & kphoto album; not very familiar with looking at private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to describe all your pictures with & kphoto album; manage and spend hours over hours is of course that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & kphoto album features an image _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed at all. all of these options are available right click on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the matching entries for this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and image down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphoto album; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphoto album; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete screen space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move in and out of the image. you can use the mouse to zoom in with the mouse. the Plus button zooms out in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. using the uniformity function sets the zoom, so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom-operations that work with videos are that in and out are zooming with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to just mark the picture and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to display images with features as you see them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view a picture with which features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have attributes to your images, they are available in your browser. you can see this in the browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, you simply provide all of them with annotations. this is described in detail. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window. if you can view categories in a thumbnail, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the attribute after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case allows you & kphoto album; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painting later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">To switch off the painting mode of & kPhotoAlbum; select on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation about & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire modell- views is displayed yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, as all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene using either the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct and re-click the input errors or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the Properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window layout as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it freely. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs on the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating elevations: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchorage, drag the start on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the Anfal bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Anfal bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window arrangement... Save. a dialog will display where you can save the window layout under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 actual. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon Add the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render modes... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to use a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size of the map you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination-field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because the super-sampling refers to the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam per pixel. if the difference between colour values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually tracked further and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays didn't hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for that here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select File Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set by & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click on Help in the Properties view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. here, set the path to your retention and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in paths to & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail delity for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you display a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used to render the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window orders. in the window dressing section explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combined Standard Window arrangement: displays all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window layout when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Add Window Regulations list displays all existing window classifications. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the selected window layout. new views can be created with the Add button and select selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with card card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and hovering does not anchor the view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth clincher view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the term camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation about & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you apply the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a cadre (insertion final body cuboid) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a complicated method to resolve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the + in front of the object. you will see only the default options for each new object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first object. the pigment will then change in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and bullet in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now by clicking on the icon, you should obtain the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the checkboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one-color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply because you have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy to create as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or Apply button), so the ball has floating above the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now yields a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, set up a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection settings result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even when Metallic is not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities you are using & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye to which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, any scene that should be rendered is some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Replay.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or override an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, keyboard shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to modify or add new shortcuts for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to manipulate each diffraction on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general features that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not work.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and steer Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command to join any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default settings and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore occurrences if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Your script to display the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok put the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is alluded. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece (e.g. the metadata or unit length) with DCOP functions.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle Paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to add your own entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform, for example, clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name like e. g. meinskript.bigokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an exhaustion catamaran script. for this reason, you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the functions and gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find, for example, modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of freedoktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the daily Lib library. you can locate the file using ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support in & Amarok; is somewhat more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib has been compiled with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then turn off automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open during a crash). if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-Infos, but do not label them as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: symbol lookup error: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmapERK7Qpixels, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarca app' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems are easily solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please only make a mistake there if something is at your fault in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Display Review. click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>

<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, & Amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you have to register all the components. perform follow-up registers to register all GStreamer components.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag and drop items from the collection browser into the playlist. the small text box to filter the collection will make it easier for you to search for specific pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it under the button of the button. you will find this button on the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the option to importing playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, select Actions Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. simply drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the playback button.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window is a scroll display showing the currently running piece or the currently running stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired play time for the remaining time of play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, extensible window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display there are also the buttons PL and EQ. the button PL activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set the equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control, and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that there is in no other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users is powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser shows different information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser-designs. the context-browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows are later explained in detail. they represent information about the current piece in each different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have previously used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow starts off. the information displayed there has now been distributed in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context-browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play instantaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "among the" "" "Recommended Pieces" "" "you find the favourite pieces of this performer. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the performer, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on any pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text below, the downloaded text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using the scripts themselves. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok will try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is still running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the lyrics for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division is made according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list of different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and including by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the grouping as desired.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection once you have something at the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a drop-down selector with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. there are various time windows available, ranging from the last 24 hours to one year. you can also select your overall collection, whereby the filter is practically shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. double-clicking on an entry gives you the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player. see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files into the trashcan... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up list - Changes an album marked as a set back into a normal album. after that, the album is no longer displayed in different interpreters but again under the associated performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The Playlist Browser makes handling of many playlists easy. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow will be used for connecting & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; to use for example your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces sorted on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you're done click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can listen to music in the file music.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files by simple dropping can be difficult. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: thus, dropped files will be automatically inserted at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all of the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location and dropping. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the return button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination of it) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing whitespace, then enclose the search term with quotes: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can search for larger or smaller ones. for example, Rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax versions as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist toolbar is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add to the playlist. to the right, you will find Playlist, Empty Playlist, and Random Mixer.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, follow the Undo and Restore buttons. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, larger Analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button on the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one that you see in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's Configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many other available buttons for the toolbar, for example, playback controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting toolbars there.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the Status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualisations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry hides a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The Cover Administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration. select:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature, you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue a number appears in the playlist. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">The management of the queue allows you to open a queue management tool. if you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predetermined (details to set up these later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random items from your entire collection and adds other random items while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: audio Acrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a load .fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the desired playlist, drag it into the playlist window or right-click on you and then select Load. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced with the new one. so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlist mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlist's recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece to your collection, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, activate the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as a starting point. using the same menu entry, the dynamic mode can also be disabled again.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will continue to grow, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right have already been described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you cross several playlists, & Amarok will add random items from each of the playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts allow your own settings. you can adjust the settings by running the script and then clicking on Setting.</seg>

<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you do not use files for a multi-session CD. the data of the previous session will always be included, even if this function is not used. it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD copying dialog. this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a CD which you can then burn sometime later. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image of a DVD, which you can then burn sometime later. in addition, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. the converting / reduction of a DVD by means of copying dialog is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>

<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when the wizard is started.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at startup. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; -interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task are crucial to which the included programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all have common, support & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef currentProject () void formatted () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can generate a project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used for data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void addurl (KURL url, QString parent) void addurls (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void addurls (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void set VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCD Project) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde; with it can easily be recorded audio CD; s can be read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and by many encoders which encode these WAV files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. other encoders may be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per caption) compress into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distributions, so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything by yourself. however, only the encoders need to be installed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodizer provides a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, & audio creator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to circumvent the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting-up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling for reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand for the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the step by step example there are more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of CD data according to the creation of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialogs - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. note that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read out and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pics) for program events (like reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for aligning the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression, depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important, since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recording devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see the 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approx. 5.5. always requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate of about 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car osterparks. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or retrieved by the program from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoder program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keywords when MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / input the information, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of Pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from being harmed by the & CD; any information that is publicly available on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb you can use another (fake) address as the system set up. in this type of configuration, so it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; set up for the use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD; to save wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia will be used; if you want to know more about it, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoders package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. further information on encoders is found in the chapter Welcher encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading real on it and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy protected audio CD; check the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still uncertain about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate packet for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; anything that is probably done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each issuing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program using freedb to download the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to change it every time you read a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">/ dev / cdrom is often a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card holder General Settings. here you can't do much. here you can define an additional conversion. in our example everything is left / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, please select, so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card file CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selector is easier, a & CD; entry is found, begins immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; renamed, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, note that if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb is not used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database beforehand. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both are equivalent to the server, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously reading pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you click this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to make something yourself with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is on average between 224 and 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>

<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD. if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is written. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each issuing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from those for one & CD; with successfully logged data. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, rather than fetch it from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, just like in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, consult the questions and answers section of the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; in accordance with the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Actual title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Actual Title' input field, unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Comment field of the album can be used for individual comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successfully retrieving the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist's and album names (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; this option is set up on the Basic Settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. look to the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read-off CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't provide the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked in this way are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece in or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the selection Selection of the selection process, so this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently being read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You see this error message if you attempt to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in the case of weak machines, the result is unclear. the computer with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; today is maintained within the cde; CVS is part of the kdemultimedia package. however, if you are familiar with CVS, you can download from there an anonymous copy. most distributions already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still to read? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of program start), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? who reads this probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; may it do. at least after making contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player of & kde; besides others, he has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; and kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards for storing text in MIDI files (real-time events or textual events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">If you finish & kde; during playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file of one & konqueror; -windows in the & kmid; -windows. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button on the toolbar, select the Abplay from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically once you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once a piece is played, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and driving with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and so change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure applied to the space bar like printing on the button pause or selecting the menu item break in the menu, thus interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no play is played starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and again both. some pieces don't have any lyrics at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don't have to set anything manually. so if you want to enable automatic text selection in the Settings menu, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the Itineraries or Property Listings from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the selected items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you need to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection while opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatic Add to Collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied while opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the still open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select collections from the submenu Abplayerorder of the Collections menu, the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Previous piece, the entry ForPrevious piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are non-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map compiles general MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type change patch to jumpet and always lets a trumpet sound when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required translations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order, and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example doesn't support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do so, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (bullet shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, in which each note is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped to a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to make sounds on the percussions-channel. see for example the provided keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N channel. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap is used with the name name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender Ratio is given in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. therefore, if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent a decimal point in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM says that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two notes up to one octave up. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find this in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you will see which tones are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and a good synthesizer gives you a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Do not forget to set Automatically add the collection beforehand. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default speed, double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a MIDI file) or want to play a file, simply switch to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the file to the Windows by & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to your collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.Dmid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as a hobby I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or an MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group, I will list all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me since I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have made & kmid; I wrote completely in my spare time and got money by anyone. I would like to point out that I only want to continue programming because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks are also to all these excellent musicians who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kim.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it will run as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course hear no music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SMB Player; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andochable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that only appears when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the permanent playlist category.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. if you select an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can do that only if & SMB; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / SMB /, can be changed by an editor, then select from the View menu and select the next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select playlists from the menu Remove from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & SMB, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB Player; note the ~ / .kde / share / apps / SMB / .x.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / SMB / exit.xml files. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation on startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture: & lt; smilgt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of SMB. here you can see the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like setting the backend per mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swf dec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & SMB; it can even be inserted into the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & SMB Player; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & SMB Player; can be used in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend for a particular mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, you need to configure the device and the TV channels. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMplayer, the dialog in the settings is under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected (e.g. PAL for West Europa), the correct name probably has a dvd in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">As the VDR support of SMB can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, from KMplayers for the sources different names are used. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, external source, introversion, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint that I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is root after installing the device. it is important to make sure that / dev / cdrom drives to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly, why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. among Unix-like systems it is likely to be used on the package & texLive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution should include the documentation of the distribution / installation CD; / DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; project contains some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for various distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly need to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact via the Kile; website should be established.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have questions about the compilation of & Kile; on or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; desktop. & Kile; provides the opportunity to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within these a simple, immediate and customized access to all & latex; also offers & Kile; the ability to complete, compile, rework and troubleshooting within the source code as well as conversion and view tools for this. finally, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities, read the manual of Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right pronunciation: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, can also use a Laie (engl lay) & latex; -macros. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book on it. to be able to speak properly, good books such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex should be used: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just as other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the most general features such as paper format, side numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ 'documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick entry Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for the rapid creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) offers some options for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this defines the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrbookt], book (DIN) [scrbookt], book (DIN) [scrbook.com], film [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the encoding of the system. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as standard. best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for & latex; for the integration they only need to be balanced in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (in compliance with German DIN regulations). they should always be used in the creation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is simply a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - as well as other source editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you see larger areas of a gray text on the screen, it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, you will hear it by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to the setting of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu Setting; set up the LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful when creating your own. once a DVI; file [rendered file] was created], & Kile jumps; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the ordinary output file of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the return search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element was clicked into the DVI; file, the corresponding section is jumped into the & latex; source search is the exact opposite of it. once on a section in the & latex; source code was clicked, the corresponding area in DVI; -viewer jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this feature is used in working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other involved .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set via project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file on the "nderungenÂ" file becomes superfluous, and there is no call from & Okular; after quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for fast structuring of the document into sections, chapters, sections,...</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as keywords, notes, notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified name (select a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last field of selection named GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for setting the font size. you can specify the font size for the main text, the notes, etc. the following fonts are available for processing:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and stacking settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12 pt] specifies the font size. if font size is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the Building or the Quick Build button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document is out of place, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using Quick Build, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (close environment) is a text that is handled differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the incorporation of the fonts within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only secured within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold, sive print, submissions etc. can be added. these commands end either using the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be recursively displayed with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source code with the & latex; markup language has been presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for better readability of the document. to do this, mind. a quote, a few passages in the fat and italics pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be converted back to the editor (in the internal viewer). its window has to be closed by an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file is created, the document can be printed or converted into a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I natively). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer created. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as needed for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using a file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code is created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-selected search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. for this purpose, only Modern under Settings Kile must be set up... Tooling Building is balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for pre-selection, the mouse pointer has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on for subsequent search. the jump to the corresponding area in the DVI; viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Octitular; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & Kile; opened and jumped to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Octitular; to be specified as text editor (Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If a mistake is used when using the & DVI; the viewer does not open, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file explains the source of error in the source code. in the editor you can use the PreTeX errors and the latest LaTeX errors for jumping between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you have clicked on the corresponding button on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be re-written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ugly users of & latex; usually use the same intro for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting a file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in settings box... Settings can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which character strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering documentary class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps have to be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default selected template.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. if a simple way to create a template is deleted, search for a template on the Internet and be executed under the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kate; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in the menu directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its features should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of almost all the commands in & latex; use can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that in this way, if you click on\\ par from\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par will be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source code and to highlight these. for example, the & latex; -orders from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumping marks. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu-based editing of hock marks or the corresponding key collars enable the jump to the next or last jump brand. this is also highlighted by this jump brand, so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & Kate; already excellent features offers, in & Kile; important functions for writing an & latex; it always supports many environments and groups, and therefore support & Kile; specific commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word below the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also includes & latex; -commands with a return stroke (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; provides the key root Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit, the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description of the Edit Selection paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile provides; for more commands under Edit environment for a more simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumped to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumped to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command completes the recently opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumped to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumped to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the graded parenthesis of a & tex; -group #, the group jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested group clamps quickly the overview can be lost. this command finally completes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a substitute for the purpose. for the beneficial implementation is used in & Kile; the sign is used for two simple notes. also for the end of the application the sign is used. & Kile; knows this case and add two closing symbols for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic import of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use foreign specific settings (e.g. naur or french) and therewith German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key for & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is in a list environment (e.g. enumerates or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close & Kile within a table setting; the current line with\\\\ with a line termination completes.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings Box; Set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environment and all Et characters (amp;) among themselves. & Kile; try to invent it. by pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab on the above line. although this tab is not the added tab, add & Kile; some space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already a good source code completion, this was added in & Kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) still extended. three different modes are installed. all of these modes can be configured for different modes of work under Settings Box... fully adjustable.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the return key, the last letter of the entry is removed and, as a result, the list of errors can be added. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jumping marks can be added, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of jumps NÃ ¤chste jump-mark and the desired parameters can then be retained.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; full settings can be made to these lists. you can choose different types of utilities for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as utilities of the common language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The mode command mode is not useful for complete environments. it is always possible to enter a few letters with\\ begin and the call to complete mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-loss mode over the menu workaround or the key-key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears\\ begin. after that, the ambient order can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is accomplished, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile, realises that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Setting Kile; setting up... Kile; full settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the wiper list of the full-loss mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of lines that can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile can be fully furnished. as an example of an extraction list, the file example.cwl, where for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated via the menu editing or the key rg + alt spacebar, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large utilities are not helpful for automatic complete completion. however, it has been found that many offices are written more than once in a document. with this, & Kile offers; the completion of all already written words.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Setting... Kile can be disabled completely. here, the threshold value for the display of complete damage can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The support files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (default), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible. in view of the basics of graphic formats, the sections should be kept and taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and reorders from pages. if the PDF output is used, pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools can then be converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the results of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all building tools are grouped into the menus to create compiling, compiling and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like and eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used as keyboard alto; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer by Alt; 3; 4 the DVI; file converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be added to the Project's New Project.... The following information is queried for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the filename, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The Script function of & Kile; allows to run ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can change in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile has a system-wide object (= Kile) with the following methods:</seg>

<seg id="1954">Automatic update: when switched on, the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: types of mimetypes for detecting various types of files. using the Default button, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in a different way as file opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is extinct from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting here is expelled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface has been changed by modifying the MDI modes and andoading / appending views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>

<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings area, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree by editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be automatically opened. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting shortcuts (a type of templates) that can be unfolded when editing a larger text. shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause shortcut means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins are KPart-applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, the most well-known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be stated:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin when you start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in read-only mode: check if the plugin refuses to load it. only-Read-Kparts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, you can choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin Selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all the holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view where the output (like in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that in the normal case it does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Started the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and running information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debugging request has been started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debugging requirement is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger guides the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day shows. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of & DTEP; even. tool bars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a typing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bearing the name of the descriptive language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause any break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it, achievable via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a list selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New Action to create the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut identified by this action. clicking the User Language button can be used to assign a keyboard shortcut; Keiner can be used to remove the current keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although skilled paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir parameter in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This method tries to find the script in the following places: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input from & quantaplus can be received in the standard input. in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the executed application can also be rerouted according to the input. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error messages. it can be specified what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value selector output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the popup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you plan to use it, activate "Edit Tag" dialog if available so that input can be entered while using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that better represents the action, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Diagram Other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; by default uses 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does, but also for all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually released as loose, starte, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start; -Tag in the current document is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags as there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to tool bar, or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators in several groups. open the tool bar to set up dialog on Settings toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by masturbating all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up to the correct folder. after New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be saved in the correct folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search for an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; - Language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part will be left to you, we will treat the second one here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top item = Section1.html Sec2.2, # Section1.html... [Context] ContextList = funcqhtml tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see the following documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of docrc file which is used to design context sensitive help. for example, when writing an & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements which should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file easily, after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the disk resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places, there is an Email menu entry, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP), send to the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where any other & quantaplus; users can download them. contributions will be checked and only available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a contribution, we recommend signing the resources for which it uses a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK will start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD Package (DTEP) menus, the toolbar of the toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, explores & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that should appear in the! doctype tag, like HTML PUBLIC / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with details of newly created & DTEP; adjusted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and gain full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter seeks to bring them close to them without understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this enables the group of administrators to backup different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which mixes the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the tabs with information and toolbars. please hit in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tabs, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area leads to a further context menu concerning the edited document content, such as editing / copying / pasting, editing the text under the mouse pointer, using the word under the mouse pointer or opening the file when the string under the mouse pointer calls a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the symbol representing the tag. now, you can enter the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to & quantaplus; navigate, open and strip them. in the display with tabs are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed using the contextual menu that appears.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; It is open to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the breakdown in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element a list of commands is opened in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can quickly change attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed on project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive by & kmail;. if you receive a tool bar in an email, you can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus. now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & node; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why development, what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffold is not only this all possible, but allows users and developers to expand & quantaplus, as they need for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details in the details are with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or run helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffee Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry being removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. check the section on templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there special characters to & HTML; -Description, so they appear correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Toggles the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very useful when your & PHP; -Script returns error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and switching on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the location of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes like & quantaplus; the project administrates. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. actions need to be added by Settings. actions must be saved using Toolbar Settings... or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team to make the toolbar available for the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load an & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setting dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar denies when this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu the available plugins are listed under the above menu items. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the switch can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. it is recommended to use the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar, or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in accordance with the context of the mouse cursor, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information panels can later be set with Shift; F7 project project properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.err.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the remote computer setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default, templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. at server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Allow files to be mounted somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the files you want by hook or, by removing the checkbox, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles, or changed using the Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>

<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Open Project... from the menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves as well, but the opening and opening entries are missing with... in the context menu that can be accessed with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>

<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbar elements in & quantaplus; the best is to be styled by the tool toolbar. using and adding differ. adding tool bar is treated at the bottom of the Adding of Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and symbols on it can be set using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, toolbar can be renamed or toolbar adjusted, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will additionally be removed and action processed which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically a document skeleton, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; use templates basically like a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before using.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is anything that is not pure text. it can be binary files except text, images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually added in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, special documents are created in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, combined in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save As local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save choice as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged and dragged onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop or insert over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and select a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can specify headers and footers or dynamically combine with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, click the folder in the template table with the right mouse button and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selector with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled once parental attributes are tipped.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set to default, it would automatically disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably are in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows pretext or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and can be used by copying contents to a folder with special headers / footers a whole presentation already using the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to it, right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be accessed from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to source code editor if necessary, where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol shows the Vohandabsence of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; in order to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. pressing F9 activates this mode, the key press moves the active cursor from one window to the other, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Quanta. by choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatic. in principle, the time interval can be set automatically. basically the recommendation is: a small span for fast calculators and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Let's assume that you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information on the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords in column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">It is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor, by moving the arrows. in rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strangely. the selection functions as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the return key or the removal key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way on the toolbars, as in the source code editor. note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed every other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar buttons such as the tables wizard or the Listen Assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. unlike other styles for style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; successfully compile, only need the libxslt, libexslt and libxml libraries, which are already available with a typical installation of & kde.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & blediff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there were no clues to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kDiff3; differences within a line and changes to white characters represented. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & diff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merging is also fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; while automatically selecting the correct changes. the merge editor among the differences windows allows you to edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & clogged; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Kdiff3; shows the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more anger when someone alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">QBM 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog will remark your selection and display it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is introduced. however, if a file is selected for A, for B and C, a folder, then uses & cdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kDiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison begins immediately. in the open dialog, you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it above a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can not remove anything from & clogged; only the drop-down of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed through the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for this is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not as important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the reference windows) also has an Info line with the output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually, the automatic merge already contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the skip to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">When only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, no more line is left in the group by automatic merging or by editing; then this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a mark you might copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the options ignore the options or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, down, side up, start, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other buttons to edit in the display window. with the insert button you can switch between insert mode and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns syncs the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation that you can jump to the current / first / last difference, the next / previous distinction (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-Up), the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-image upward) or the next / previous conflict. therefore, conflicts must be distinguished between resolved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is checked, whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is not necessary. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally override the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use a carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line endings of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when returning and restored at the next start. (menu Setting - &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered scastly. on these systems, the button presets automatically adjusts an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual to the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & clogged; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step will not ignore each line. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. even when merging, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, while others save only one line feed '\'. usually ignore & cdiffer; the carriage return character is made visible, but like a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. as a result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complex and large files, but slow in very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before continuing to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically solves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need time-to-use, then use the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. look for details under documentation on directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to terminate & diff3; stop and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kDiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The code for coding appears a brief description of what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded caption column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed in addition to the normal yet another caption column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply fill out the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Classifies the comparison window side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files. merge current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default file name. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to that external command. in & Kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is handed over to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is given (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own pre-processor, which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line operations to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a superlative expression that matches every character string. the\\ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in uppercase. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line breaks suitable. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / substitution / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations will only change the data that the line-like algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge whole folders with & kDiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, & cdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folders, a small news window informs you about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded down. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or by double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to fold all sub-directories and open all sub-directories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The Name column in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed again about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries varies.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option synchronizes directories is active. then select & kdiff3; select the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied & diff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merging (unsafe) then explores & clogged; the date of the files and performs the newer file for copying. if the files are different but the same date is identical, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file is processed after the other. the Status column shows Dept when the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a last check and see if the status is okay everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds) or all entries at once. once you have selected all Merger actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you haven't specified a destination folder, C will be used as the target in the three-folder merge mode, B will be chosen as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to select only the current entry, select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulations and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file) then a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, you can restart / resume directory merge or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kDiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & Kdiff3; hit an error, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge operation (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged, & clogged; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them later. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & Kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is turned off, symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and browsed recursively. (note that & kDiff3 does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to yourself would lead to an infinite loop and & kDiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed benefit will cost you some degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are the same size. for example, this can be useful if the modification date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option can be turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file, it will be suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view stays visible during merging single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can disable the Directory & Text window option in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do so, use the current file merging from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders to open to local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permission or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select Insert in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally required & cDiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a KPart, & kdiff3; then declines & c diff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & cdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & Kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is called Compare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or are going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE does not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. cDiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines disappear to each other, this is the purpose of this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required was so far too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removal of text suddenly lt; No src left; published and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">In order to be able to use all functions of & Kdiff3, you need to use & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install diff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & Kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kDiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have trouble compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the update function after modifications to these options.)</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & kmag; a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is called the magnifying window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged portion of the screen and is referred to as the selection box below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer as a moveable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & kmag; to do so, set a selected screen area in the magnifying window (select mode) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor on the screen edge (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer setting. please note that & kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift; button or the & MMB; use it, you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click, as soon as the mouse pointer stays in the same place for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse-click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, even through the use of your computer, pain can also be caused. if you suffer from pain that is related to your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by mouse click, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse-click away as soon as you interrupt the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The intelligent move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulating. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the mouse is switched on, the shutter speed is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving is done in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse-shift. is this function activated, generates a slow move to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow move to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; you can move to shorten the reaction time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you adjust to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is checked, & kmousetool is started; at any startup of & node; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings are reset to the status after the last pressing of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best thing is to use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent move should be turned off first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware at which places there is a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not present a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually rather simple. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">When you have removed the ball you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or a fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started a move. if you are using the intelligent move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation no longer can end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there, where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, an accidental mouse click can cause undesired reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent move, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible in this way to select text, copy it to the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice about this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you are just starting & kmousetool; instead, mark text as follows: drag a mouse-click at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shifting time begins when it is intelligent. however, you can also use the intelligent move without the mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">Um & kmousetool; to be able to use, the Xtest extension for & X Window must be installed. that should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clip is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is slowing down. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and inflicting pain on the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dropping can also be performed with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2553">In the lower part, you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the shortcut key. if you have selected a text passbook, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">You can either add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either through the selection in the menu bar, in the toolbar or through a drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filters work on the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing replaces parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; will be delivered with predefined string filter filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the reformatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery by & ktops; are some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktops. if you have set a female voice on the card holder for example, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a notice is sent to & ktops, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters will be processed in line up from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the establishment of string enforcement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the respective replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to be distinguished by the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Erase column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file that appends the entries from the file to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2645">The application id running programs will get you with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID number-3432 indicates, you are allowed to enter only copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box This filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. so, the words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions. however, if you have the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package name.</seg>

<seg id="2651">With the speaker selector filter, you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card holder or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that text from kmail should be read from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops; a text is passed to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program dictates, which sends the text to & ktops; and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card board. by using the speaker selector filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you would like to extend the use of another synthesizer, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used to support SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops, you need an up-to-date development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages and the development files for the program "speech dispatchers."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktops; from the source text archive for cdeaccessibility or downloaded the tarball every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktops, first check if speech dispatcher works properly with your voice synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of ktops that uses the program speech dispenser. the tmsgr program should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech discs is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into single phrases. the user can return set or paragraph styles, let them repeat, stop or cancel the issue.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application displays text on & ktops, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be selected automatically. if you want to learn more about how & ktops; select a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add Spokesperson on Add, and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card holder is displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only need to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text to be passed to the festival. if you have voices, the & ktops are known, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a certain knob and display this grey, the voice you have chosen doesn't allow you to adjust these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized faster (with larger memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you haven't set up a speaker yet (or click Apply to Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed at the start of ktth mgr. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol ttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and tmgr is not running yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this gives you the possibility to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are performed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the precisely edited sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card holder.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single phrases. this allows & ktops to begin quickly, since only the first set needs to be synthesised, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set level detection filter. at the first start of & ktops, a set-level detection filter is set automatically as a default. you can change its settings or add further set-level detection filters, but beginners will not be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by selecting. turn off the speaker selection and enter text for reading. check the selection of speakers, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes. of course, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then faster with pre-reading, because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which may take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel your text orders on the card map, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-level detection filter is automatically set up when you start ktachmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set level detection filters compare text with a regular expression for typing and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set-level recognition filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knot), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set-level detection filter, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the subscriber settings for the application on the card board. the card is displayed when</seg>

<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, showing all characteristics of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktops; otherwise select & ktops; otherwise select & ktops; the speaker most likely matches the originally set characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired subscriber properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired subscriber here. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property will take precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a specific application will send text in a different language than the language set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be traced through the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card board for speaker setup. depending on the selected voice this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the Speaking Speed are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML-converter filter, and set up the Speaker Speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't like websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktops; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before using & ktops, first check whether your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you have received with the Synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. for this, please refer to the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to let websites read, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example coi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the coding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic such as coi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">The festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; Synthesizer. then festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete language delivery system. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone.

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworks.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; allows the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation a new module will be displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworks.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be fully installed and configured to enable & knetworks.This tool actually displays and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection will be offered. it is the platform from the list to select which corresponds best to the distribution and the relapasestand. by marking the setting non-recurring questions the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter the system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button to set up the device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to view the dialog with more options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so there is no further setting required. in the selection list either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the choice of manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field netmask the subnet mask is set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. switching on an off-off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host on the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be rearranged by selecting an entry and downgrading or downgrading in the list with the drop down or down button in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add button... a group of hosts for name resolution can be added to a DNS server. it will add the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">Select one entry from the group calculator and then click the Edit.... button to view the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name-known calculator specifies the hostname-to-IP address for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list of names known to name contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this version of IP is still in the test to replace version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... Add the New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and press the Add button. if the known computer has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named machine from the list and select Edit.... The Modified Calculator dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installing the binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical user interface can be used like kpackage or the installation tool for its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second one is discussed by & knetworks.conf; utable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace more extensive knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found great distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future, so this description is currently concentrating on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the point of contact that runs a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be arbitrarily selected!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own calculator). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you can find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworks.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is a different content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly re-sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility of storing multiple archives on a tape. the development of & kdat; carried out with two goals. the first was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife posed: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; RST the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognizes & kdat, don't recognize the pre-tensioner on the tape, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat, the pre-tensioner, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the band index is to be regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the tape, indicates that the integration for the tape has been solved and indicates a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-type must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & kdat,. if your tape drive requires that a tape can be formatted before using it, this must happen before using the tape of & kdat. floppy-tape drives usually require formatting of tape, whereas DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity & kdat, continue with the format of the tape. all data on the tape will be lost. after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog box appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item Testing....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the scan process has been started, the dialog box appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the verification settings, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reestablish the restore, the files that are to be restored need to be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a checkmark. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will pop up for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be found separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then have been saved.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the button files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, conveys & kdat, before the tape is mounted the command mt load on the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; lock the ejector at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing the integration of & kdat, the tape is automatically eject. do not use this option for floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tries & kdat; the hardware-side block size for the tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat, in any case tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this icon is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to provide quick access, for example, to information on problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of specific programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions that can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog tries to open the system log; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will not show you, and it will open rather than a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely you do not have permission to read under Linux normally in the / var / log file, for normal users.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or after input strings. in addition, enter a string into the filter bar. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only the log lines are displayed that will be shown for the selected filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if the filter search term string is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, also select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the Protocol file system log, select the process column, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as the protocol lines of the level indicator. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron Protocol), you can show the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the Add to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new entry lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more up-to-date information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also see the directory of the & node; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather familiar (and also named as) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling program start-up at boot of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you would like to start when you run the system or switch to another runtime. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services don't contain such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something on startup, which has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre-set Runtime 3 is. if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you will be able to repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; also, I could also have a user-run level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; start.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not trivial: just drag an entry from the field of Available Systems Services to one of the six Runtime to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runtime (or position). this only happens if they pull out an entry from the realm of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you need to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover items that have been thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another run level, move it to the clipboard by cutting it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired Runtime with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sort number or name of an entry, press the Enter key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu call for confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runways, and now the machine starts to boot constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed to run under Runtime X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or configured incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation relates to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save button in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled user settings (quota) for users, a card box will be created on which you can make individual settings. other cards may appear, if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management board map appears, if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD applications.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card box only appears if for at least one embedded filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (identifiable at the file quota user / quota group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limitations of space each in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with space limitation with the help of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primur Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog features include a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO booting manager, add, remove and change boot password, change time to boot from the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
