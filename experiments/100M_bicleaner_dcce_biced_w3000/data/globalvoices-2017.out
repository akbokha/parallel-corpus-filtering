although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was reinforced .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very cau@@ tious love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops with his mind behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people re@@ acted to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nom@@ in@@ ised by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that welcomed people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schauung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who lives the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump is pav@@ ing his way to nom@@ inate Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ ided over a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note d . Ü ) : as much as &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , as the big Van Jones named , has just killed what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ans , whose story , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans find a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would someone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and my heart breaks me .

the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what &apos;s the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ ger ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ e violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made up of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music by the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is an orchestra consisting of instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens under an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the waters of Liber@@ ian waters before it searched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is not regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail tempo , with the information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions now take place in real time , trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to label ships that fish in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious cycle routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports on the basis of this information . what does this mean that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay punishment , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , bo@@ g@@ us license papers , declar@@ ations of imagination , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; target the missing international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not run my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is now trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information . it aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform , together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Protection Organization , a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who where to do - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that had f@@ ished without license earlier and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i are now seeing a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats have been purchasing more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined forces there , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to announce its first great triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license , and used tra@@ w@@ l nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative work to protect the oceans works across the world ocean .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is sharpen@@ ing further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ aining the country &quot;
street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s inauguration .

after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s application for a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went to the void while gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against it can be found .
the debate is also held in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal Kar@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily routine of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the reluc@@ tance of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes in her latest article the context of government resolution as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine is , the referendum on minist@@ erial exercise was the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called on the demonstr@@ ators to join forces on 27 October to support the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , should continue to pers@@ ist for the removal of the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strikes and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .
keep in mind ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ N@@ ry

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ conqu@@ ering Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26th . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most often shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial proced@@ ural procedure - this has now been proved in the eyes of many people on the road by the presence of countless people .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s about this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures have been fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your minist@@ erial exercise !
on the road !
others are analy@@ zing these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ fers to mu@@ te critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
the trial ended on 24 August 2016 investigating crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis was not a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was the Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passport only that they do not kidn@@ ap you one day and I must save you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Argent@@ ine Revolutionary Party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine , because my father had educated me .
at the military base I had to destroy papers which had listened to the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything .

the prisoners are tor@@ tured there &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the car , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I pe@@ aked in and saw a couch tor@@ tured on man .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed it to one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just tied up there .
she seldom cl@@ amped a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ laid it with water and charged him with a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty whi@@ rl@@ wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that someone can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he took me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye @-@ tie .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were bound hand and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people slept sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why then have you brought me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data from survivors , the civilian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , charges the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ ted came here .
if you look at the map , you can see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above reached that they were to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time , at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military character , which one takes off an enemy that is fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... it is not war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal your car on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me , and cried ,
if you go so far I will find you and kill yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photograph of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover jacket of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied that no problem , they can put me under the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why are the cor@@ p@@ ses going to disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl with her mother who had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not also had families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ established , they fet@@ ched machinery to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I was repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they supposedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I replaced the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally cancelled my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .

all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pi@@ ero De Monti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :

the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research was 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the land on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error to a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was dis@@ semin@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which they can extend their driving licence have been witnesses of a particularly mis@@ erable translation in the last month .
on a shield , the Japanese word was also fal@@ sely invented in the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is in Kyoto , is saying :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could such an English translation come ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , although not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt a bit more extensively with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents is quite a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors convic@@ ted 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the named Repor@@ ter published in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently le@@ apt to older drivers :
the article on the translation error in Yahoo received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so common in all of Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , who could translate the translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves leave translations in @-@ house translations . then the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the phrases and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that often ad@@ orn T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable to jewelry or at least harmless . however , from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more thorough translations can be expected .
hopefully the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced they had no access to the online broad@@ ca@@ ster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also took photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped and recommended that users use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activates your VPN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I subscri@@ bed to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ cin@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ cast@@ ers . this also applies to the website on which the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a web page is blocked by DNS , the server rep@@ lies er@@ ron@@ eous or refuses to respond when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ go@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third scre@@ ened channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday 6th April when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went to show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay many girls will become slaves to get an education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of a Cri@@ adi@@ te . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and raises testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of C@@ tural .
the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report from a structural member published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , there are more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money handed over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ans - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude in@@ oc@@ ulated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ans guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes care of the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households was given a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent strikes . she died shortly afterwards .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ te in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Population Register Office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra struck Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ te .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people gathered in protest and called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ te .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ te
the cri@@ es are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ si , in which her father worked , had to sign in bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all of them and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours .
she had to share time so that she had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner she was ready with learning the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the parti@@ sans Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
on some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while he was intelligent , he did not enter@@ tain himself with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought I would get &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible .
but she was absolutely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never was spoken is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ te .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society endor@@ ses Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for clean@@ ers and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the site Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the homeland who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad turned out again :
dear friends , I have found one . I think if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ans , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ bin@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ ans , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ans , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the wives of the Guar@@ an@@ í ) and the native population ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) and that they become easy victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to display power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations governing the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , it would be established a place to grant citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could bring a sentence of up to six months of imprisonment or a fin@@ er of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ tail@@ ed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video alignment and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law is passed when it is accepted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of T@@ elecommunic@@ ation to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they control violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ her@@ s@@ ville ordered a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those destined to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thre@@ aten public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest to protest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of non @-@ governmental organization Nature are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ am through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1.000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular way of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist R@@ aza is passion@@ ately showing a different side of her country , which is not just about war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of &quot; Nature Iraq &quot; for six years .
since 2013 , she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are set up .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was an et@@ ched pre@@ f@@ ecture in nor@@ theastern Japan that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal towns disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture did not yet have an atomic accident , and already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of those affected .
residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( in the Netherlands ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary accommodation ( the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ te ak@@ u ) is still trying to res@@ ett@@ le in final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , still 36@@ 0,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such behavi@@ ors .
almost 40 percent of Ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who were living after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have re@@ opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools .
six years later , industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation , only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the nuclear lock zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants think it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how her feeling changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more information about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents are finding that there is still not enough done in disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 displaced people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
as of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma living outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . they are known to reti@@ re in proper dwell@@ ings because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when you meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that a more connecting than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer struck him with a strike against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now translated it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás reported that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation into the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer shou@@ ted by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s rus@@ hed to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , which lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado sends further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined forces just to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a stick .
police hand@@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators took place last Friday .
at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , police officers used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have squ@@ ander@@ ed street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane as over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
you must also recognize this if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot;
Cuba &apos;s For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as the el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period of time are in operation again because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per Po@@ und , issued according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ sp@@ ects &quot; issued by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation ( FAO ) .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro attending the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories came to a stand@@ still , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
the first letters began before the first closing year .
it was a matter of officially written documents that would only be distinguished regarding the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over@@ crowded and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped to build .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
Cuba &apos;s best developed industrial sector and the most important workplace has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services generated by the plants in the commun@@ es in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learnt that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to interfere , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without the prospects of the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine yields give the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that one told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene enters into retirement age 65 , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter .

first Nations youth use hip hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this using Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the teacher David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants learn topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ eb First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in Western Canada where nearly two dozen young women were murdered or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to keep my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go forward with our youth
so they can do what the Creator has decre@@ ed
in the commentary section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( some of the most expensive in Japan ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the reception sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ it@@ u ( the &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by each dish served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is now turning them into show@@ y phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ purple .
now in special sale : new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tokyo department store .
many of these artificial food have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ cu@@ es fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an aw@@ ning @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile support .
we found a good use as a mobile phone for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) .
we have also manufactured this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
for more qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # in the way to add @-@ in to the ad@@ minist@@ ation .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in foreign and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ gi@@ sts and di@@ der@@ ers regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who are involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime cannot only be feared for our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ gi@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) nar@@ rates these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have placed to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you have the assurance of my father , but you don &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my ten @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. of Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminal records money from their business month by month , until they end up not only destroying the business , but also torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never fa@@ des , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , prepare potatoes , prepare tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to show the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words un@@ true
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this article and the pages he links contain pictures where violence is depicted .
the fac@@ t@@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what about the years after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been used to manipul@@ ate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology from Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to it .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people who watched the World Cup .
houses ru@@ sted and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carb@@ oni@@ zed bodies that are lined up on the ground while persons looking at them .
but here history does not end its end .
over the years , the same photo was put up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 comb@@ at@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were lying in streets and shr@@ u@@ bs .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent feu@@ d between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo showed up again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ interpretations ; Africa Check has documented ordin@@ ances for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example mistakenly put the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee could hit blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following report , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which fal@@ sely claimed to be the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being , monks and politicians had taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , wrong@@ ly attributed their being to this statement , but did not have the image taken from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false conn@@ ot@@ ations date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the Tin@@ Eye search engine has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which they were published on which page they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been inter@@ connected ) .
here are some cases that can now be completely tra@@ cked ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of false head@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples which , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also show fake examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only addresses the false report but also disc@@ usses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .

even within Nigeria , the photograph taken from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with a tweet expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ inqu@@ ish the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar made a right to judge what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which only appeared in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech runs and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; biof@@ e@@ edback training &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of DR Congo is NOT Muslims that kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 admitted that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image will continue to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news website An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , published now , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was circul@@ ating later in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertilizer y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , spark@@ ed a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and ret@@ ards more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this were translated into Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report .
from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was contained , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
with other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only clearly appeared after the original play of 2010 , the image could ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are dozens of people with social media who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and it insul@@ ts the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been discussed in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy . at times these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used by the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
any investigation of wrong attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world which are difficult or not at all to translate .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ rem@@ esa ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you will find for example words from the Ta@@ xes language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - get tired of your parents in recognition of how you have been striving for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having been war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal different thought processes and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favourite artists . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
caused by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have gone over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missed because of the floods and mud waves .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly returned .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Th@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s le@@ thal floods are exac@@ erb@@ ating the crisis of Den@@ gue , warns the Children of Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on their way .
today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle was also floo@@ ded because of the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency deliveries to the occup@@ ants in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the pickup app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me added a &quot; flood help &quot; button , allowing users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eval of assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people included by flood and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March 21st January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust her to her four years old daughter , she confi@@ deth in me her children ; she is my rock in the burnt offering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next one , we are receiving rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound up from an American flag , other def@@ y slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ dic@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , are de@@ mus@@ cl@@ ed .
to be de@@ mus@@ cl@@ ed
I am not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ? do you know ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western world religion Rum@@ is was er@@ ased as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have already coloni@@ alized Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ car@@ ded the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to arrest them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen such powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers on American soil were spoken by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh Systems and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the nature in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
which belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims in the highest degree constitute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population is African Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was thinking about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were free Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa w@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ester , we don &apos;t wear all the T@@ ash@@ vil@@ s with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim milit@@ ants , and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lying about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the nature in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who is tear@@ ing the veil of a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our nationality .
it interfer@@ es with our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but being a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , when I kept her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection of the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as they had decades ago winning a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I will see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze them .
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - has been coloni@@ zed by an &quot; empire &quot; that a company has founded with the name Ven@@ erable British East In@@ dies Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan bl@@ esses his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , ruled by India , who he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by coloni@@ alists who have dealt with the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be a Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coloni@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first tile bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , cas@@ h@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent , had gone to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects carry a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ ores , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion involves more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registri@@ es that started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders against people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which targets largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we throw down on Muslim lands .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous im@@ prints we ste@@ er into our news editorial .
at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to grasp our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now run the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they have ma@@ stered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that might evo@@ ke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections of our humanity , there may be a story where someone is made to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations take place at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are brought and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , was even scientific at Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of deliberately and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I in the rain did during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , bombar@@ ded chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to that .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the feasibility of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to often with it is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , feel , link . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller , their dedication and representation lead to the fact that the audience list@@ ens to it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were alert ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Puerto Rico demands re@@ dress of sovereign debt by the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the aim of a re @-@ audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the Dominican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic Front for the Ne@@ ural Test of the debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ organization of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial sc@@ rut@@ iny and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with dimin@@ ishing pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; centre for new economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation , suggests a law on social responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos demands a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without the participation and conviction of the citizens , the measures imposed on the outside will be endangered by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration called the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night guard for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book titled &quot; Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; gives his friends and family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as an insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer in the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia plays a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prot@@ otyp@@ ing was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ mark of numerous civili@@ s@@ ations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not yet able to know that ten years after he began working with the work , the IS would put everything in place , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t complete this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology for me . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding any of them in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ stitute who wrote her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book@@ case of Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I will go into every detail of your voice and my words .
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my sol@@ itude ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared since the protests in 2011 .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in the hope we need to do so for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director of Cor@@ ruption caused by corruption charges again on previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison term in which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ vo@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the dis@@ em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million me@@ tics ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from the public funds of the Moz@@ ambique airports whose advice was held by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which took place on April 19th .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not carry any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many residents do not welcome the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that the company should also have instit@@ uted a disciplinary action against the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company was silent , however , and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ an social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after being sentenced to prison and half of which had been approved .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
a disgu@@ sting thing !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state had already mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ ale and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served only himself on the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become we@@ ary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are in prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , including the Fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is simultaneously criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting 10 years and was free .
and today , the company , in which he rep@@ lies funds , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ itra ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts out of the net because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting di@@ ces ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post by one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet thought that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical before releasing any posts that would be suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words on the next page .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age brackets ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all those who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author stated his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales , that would be great .
Facebook cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code @-@ based initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the chil@@ dr@@ ens marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to forbi@@ d this practice , so that the aged age is now 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage network some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ sal@@ aja Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , gathered representatives of the various religious groups in the country that the state should not interfere since that , age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago and with 18 they were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements seeking to aboli@@ sh child marriage laws followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Hin@@ du leader had no concerns to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill in general .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - in spite of 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one voted against it .
having previously been approved by the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on child marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of ministers in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has concealed the core of the thing , but you know what ? to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that is almost worth every price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it took quite a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ o @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : News , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about the importance of adop@@ ting the law , noted :
the aged age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years , regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the change of the marriage network was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who agreed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed by law .
it was a long fight ( ... )
many thanks to all activists who fought it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
yet a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Samuel Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to be able to redeem his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris al ra@@ wi , advoc@@ ate of the law , argued that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ relay suggested :
dear TV , if we think instead of talking so broad@@ ly , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about the state that our daughters are preventing them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled males who are facing them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ News to the local news service that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
the mirr@@ oring of web pages allows Turkish users to view Wikipedia contents
the Wikipedia page on Wikipedia was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally black@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular Wikipedia @-@ based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series resist@@ ed the locking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked sites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as recently posted in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( # 56@@ 51 ) was passed .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are now sub@@ merged .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. hosts computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names , making a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , however , accessible in spite of the legal ban .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
once we have heard the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to take snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country .
Con@@ son@@ ni told Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and fellow worker at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ ak pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy @-@ address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if it is locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I was at home just when Navar@@ re was suddenly called me ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river , a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood before face to face with face to face ,
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ ster appeared . he immediately sits down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the indi@@ an State O@@ dish@@ a by a false tri@@ bunal and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of their wives also not to mention in the name is also widespread among men . however , they have far fewer justi@@ fications to be feared , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , became a unique club and became the main topic of the city .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is has been working with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and manages these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open a conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to mention the names of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ eld and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home at home .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him on his name from now on .
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a century @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only ki@@ cked in front of her ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put on the women : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead , showing the mar@@ ital status :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ap@@ ex @-@ red dot if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place to exchange views and opinions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every point of discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what to hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they happen to occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sage cour@@ t@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of its own dress code , the moral connection with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ ggle their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini affir@@ ms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times but stopped saying the name of her husband again .
some , including myself , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rus@@ hing for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was the most important part of the Japanese Twitter trend , whereby many fans exchanged memories and shared their este@@ em for the Beat@@ les .
the Beat@@ les visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has been enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here quickly became aware that they had no choice at all than to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in the English classes of Japanese secondary schools .
the Beat@@ les of the Beat@@ les survived all .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to be John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , of course Japanese make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places associated with the band .
in case you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you definitely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base in terms of market technology , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
I will listen to Y@@ ester@@ day today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s target of attacks .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the area of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the Malawi border .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man @-@ headed man could reveal gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who would like to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned of the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men owing to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the assass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ ham Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ deca@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head had power , generating the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a distributed the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa on Facebook , indicating that the problem is a part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE ON Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams a country where the people would have shame to go to the street , attract sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would indul@@ ge in dish@@ on@@ est pursu@@ its , or even ch@@ ase their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald nor bald ones are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of them missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mor@@ ink@@ bal@@ a District , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ ping :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ inations of bald people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took a key role in Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) to expand public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who spend themselves as an insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are proving to be one of the pione@@ ers in the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the protests against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have come to death in custody , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New responses from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 , at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital because of liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man says that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss it with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him a treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway , Germany and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer any questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon exports to China since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China for the release of Li@@ us , as stated in an announcement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy sum@@ mon@@ ed a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as to international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to un@@ condi@@ tionally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o to embar@@ k on proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Federal Republic of Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing to Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and the United States
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate health care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police were always monitoring the room in hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact anyone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those who are involved in the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , Germany and France
on 29 June , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments it needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France would eventually record it .
Taiwan wholes@@ aler distributor
the Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan asked China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance to those who advoc@@ ate peaceful remedies for political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lators , Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling demo@@ cra@@ cies , also called on China to allow the sick intellec@@ tuals to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , under@@ signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Association of Law@@ yers of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of that , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns perpet@@ ually led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re will appear again by the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam during the last week were really non @-@ answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system .
he was able to disgu@@ ise corresponding questions with non @-@ answers in a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements made by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard who expects me - do I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that , properly associates and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both land and city .
as he plays an important role within the cabinet , the statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapur afford their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff identity ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to affir@@ m , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many of the people of Singapur ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not entirely correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of defending the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world being revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little difference between Americans and Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
we all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th of September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also said to be the most toler@@ ant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means being sp@@ itting - as well as the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure , N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can stum@@ ble .
to be harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things happening around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a leading part of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadian people don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau came on stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ores Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta who took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video indirectly relates to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army to monitor the online content and prosec@@ ute people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand implements a strict &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Atmosph@@ ere ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already being used by coup leaders during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ k@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic War has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al are showing striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sign@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ asien .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ ar@@ sia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians living and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ k@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 some 40,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ ire and rarely are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it &apos;s hard for him to finish it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us that we let ourselves be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ k@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district government provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if vac@@ ations are , we visit .
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is concerned with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they commemor@@ ate the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once there , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a small boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now persec@@ utes the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who are responsible for in@@ adequ@@ acy in their lives .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; accommo@@ dates migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
on the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ th year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectac@@ les frame and gold coloured ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
there is a par@@ rot in the vesti@@ bu@@ le in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have been sleeping outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys medicines they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao is travelling with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a Guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his workplace from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , has offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the home of Mama Afrika everything is full of guests again .
in the ais@@ les , travelers hear cal@@ m@@ ly their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair lichen , which she has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she imag@@ ines her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , implemented by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network .
this app with under@@ age filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often categ@@ ori@@ ze extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media outlet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was based on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police poll@@ ed the inhabitants random@@ ly , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances that are meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( German ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description which shows that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all governmental branches , public authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi &apos;s regional capital to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action inf@@ ring@@ es the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors , the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even though the Earth is on the axis of evil . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone erected .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough so that I &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters of the city were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is blocked up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined a grand picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed all the way to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear you cry out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes settled on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this cursed movement lies in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ am through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ tend all details exactly before I enter the room .
in other words , they have probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately put them on without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ cra@@ t left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : to strike with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief mate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time of hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately be inter@@ ro@@ gated .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled at the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams are ring@@ ing each day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of spo@@ il@@ age until I saw the yellow light that presented us to the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was aired : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ list and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that take him away : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those days and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or bad to be punished , although I did nothing to earn this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked previously as a garbage collector , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t like the reason why he was coming next to an electrically loaded staff .
electricity flow@@ ed throughout my entire body , enough to supply all my neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed that happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and leave you , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he hur@@ ries to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ entations , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria until the very end of Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ akes in water soluble N@@ es@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has some weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot j@@ un@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose actually speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the interior ministry Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance by the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ting the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms , and the main reason for the concert announcement .
the MEPs and former spokes@@ woman in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ t said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who continue to advoc@@ ate an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement would probably not simply be a shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch all the way to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
over the past few years , the number of &quot; Ehren@@ massac@@ res &quot; has taken place in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a ban on crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be held in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from issues that were regarded as tab@@ oo in his country for a long time .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate from politics his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was in@@ scri@@ bed in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are political in the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments are torn , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but only one edited version was stre@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was later to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not be able to do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news agency set up several former government decre@@ es and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they have expressed criticism of the problems related to the corruption deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is constant giving and taking . Jordan has now led Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the aid of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and democr@@ atically @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes it .
until this time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to tow and resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ rior pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festivals which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of West Japan inv@@ aded the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ sus@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are currently visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 meter high tower was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearances and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these sophisticated hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts oppose each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools instead of obtaining a training in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of her achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel alien@@ ated ?
this is precisely the question that the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os were no longer inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters letters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos for his mer@@ its was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
but before Colom@@ bians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now enter their ranks and support them in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to come together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more necessary .
he plans to share his love with people who needed most urgent attention this year .
thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for ex @-@ fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN stores in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ o Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC introduced themselves as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters filled with support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless I addressed him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran to me about the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hu@@ gged him , and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps he was also tired of war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the outset , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC operated already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing those people who haven &apos;t yet found hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bian was prophesi@@ ed that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to weapons , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this is followed by the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and its first published on the website of OC Media .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community there has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won international head@@ lines after reports have been published that address the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their coun@@ try@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
for fear of her life she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a voluntary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Ch@@ echn@@ yan friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was there to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ y ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital .
apparently , some women had everything to say and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wing .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for respect@@ fully converting with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February , I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some perfectly unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me that I must prove it by running up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster that has not only sh@@ amed your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it became too much for my mother and she lay a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window .
after it happened the third time I realized that there was a little la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was tra@@ cked .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still wear some traditional cas@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I desire , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not close a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
that is what I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has been experienced by blood recovery .
OC Media : are gay men trapped in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to settle Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos; judgment .
as far as I know they are held there , so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they attacked some village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , but di@@ pped specifically in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there has been nothing new about them since then .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , so far there have been no reports . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have been allowed for these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately it was thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored lashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never touched me a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what kind of activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea vessels , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I do not spend a p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people myself when I sab@@ ot@@ aged breeding places .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
nature has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to tell you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ er have which , the cab@@ ard@@ in@@ ers have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think in transi@@ tioning to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide inside the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong rise in suicide for the past few months .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the suicide of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , according to Ah@@ ra@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority in August , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have been hanging .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab foref@@ athers suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where much of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran is based , was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab A@@ Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , famine , and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a multip@@ licity of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ war@@ zi young people rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed a secondary school , and 45 % have completed a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is due to a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ tend to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and for@@ cing them to earn their living outside their home country Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be employed , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing .
in view of the circumstances that the Arabic Ah@@ ra@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists strike an alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , not with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ ich@@ and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later meet in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am suffering twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I &apos;m a black woman .
and yet : when I get to talk on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used with ra@@ cial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to institution@@ alized forms of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which refers both to gender and to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , in her speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical way a bad and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of cutting skin color and gender . some of them will continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and status as a woman , so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ani@@ ties : rec@@ laim@@ ing : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alisation after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .

again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by C@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent to her .
since the end of her relationship some time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but you can &apos;t do more .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mis@@ use , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s clear ad also benefited nothing .
a few days later , the second woman returned her adver@@ t .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women make a refund at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit that they are victims of violence , reporting to the prosecution authorities at all .
content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that doesn &apos;t interfere with the 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , faulty implementation hits and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are several indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; she explains .
however , the available numbers are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence in the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the Cour@@ ts of Peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who sub@@ mits to Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women come who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed by their current or former partners each year .
by August alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then she gave up .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer associated with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I never thought I was going to be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report ab@@ uses by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated it .
many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she carried out a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ predictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many laws in Paraguay which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # fear@@ some ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ ini@@ d must declare an independent off@@ ence and punish the harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the law text was modified in a number of points in order to also win parliam@@ ent@@ arians for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is generally prohibited , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be pun@@ ish@@ able up to five years in prison .
the original bill fores@@ een that much of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must carry themselves , if they just want to refund and receive secure accommodation , to impose the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
whoever remains silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the perpet@@ r@@ ence of the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . previously , parts of the law were changed , among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes are diver@@ ging .
the section on Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a big set@@ back .

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to be subjected to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities concluded an independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a prison sentence of one year .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he ab@@ used his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the sole sul@@ tan , he has been the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the harsh efforts of the security forces , in particular the secret services of domestic intelligence , public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , and torture , in@@ timi@@ dating and det@@ ri@@ mental to human rights advoc@@ ates , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the arrest of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces captured I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , following an article published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title of &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied to justice . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the deputy chief editor was You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road , including online , banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was held before the Mas@@ k@@ at Court .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ence of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after making use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order &quot; found guilty .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i has set a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also raised the resolution of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to face attacks by the Korean government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order that extended the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the Minister once again obj@@ ected to the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times in Oman the press freedom was viol@@ ated .
other violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Korean authorities are still not willing to put an end to the extensive infrin@@ gement of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring states by promoting freedom of opinion and association , and the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely or not even mentioned in the media . it is a growing region that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines missing in the global healthcare sector that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria are far more serious in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investments for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Dis@@ eases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being the makers of himself .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
Q : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted in different ways .
it is difficult to find people coming back or coming here because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
Q : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in relation to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here .
the system that periodic@@ als make articles only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers will change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com webpage , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was only set by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of salad it can get .
but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green shade or curved leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or car@@ rots . based on this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still cultiv@@ ates salad , but now he needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as if in a river there are a b@@ oul@@ der around which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement growing in the US and all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the type Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement originates from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others to purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately to sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the ability to breed new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers rights , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes care of the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples are being offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed available to others , as opposed to patent seeds and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all of the cart@@ on features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only difficult to use .
such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are pat@@ enting on a larger scale than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted features - from those through which their taste or color improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is decreasing for bree@@ ders by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the modified conditions are much worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company advoc@@ ates the preservation of genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property implies other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
therefore , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but also promotes them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : wait 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly not support innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the struggle .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to facilitate their work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the whole , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ thered by the concept of pat@@ enting plant attributes : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features themselves .
the plants are formed by themselves and as bree@@ ders , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i member of the board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who cultiv@@ ates a variety , also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce large quantities of her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such which move to international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they manage to survive the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they lean the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .

Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy to do . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the U.S. seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also helps them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agre@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks out against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &quot; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official launch is expected to fall in schedule next year .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report , a network of relief organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true - in spite of this attack and the spot@@ ting of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , including the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network from Qatar for alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures has fallen victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for web pages and media not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or apparatus of the Egyptian government was the goal of an attack .
blo@@ ggers , the provider of which also gives a home to Zi@@ das blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempt to kill , sum@@ m@@ ons to the National Security Council , blocked blo@@ gs and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked sites from 24 May to 06 August 133 . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented providers blocked by internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that might have access to the Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs , report day after day .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves bol@@ den pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , nav@@ y and air@@ stream to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the force of violence in Rio has reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO , Global Justice , even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio released the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . whatever happens in Rio , will be published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we , as journalists , do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the paper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , when distorted , can also be used to hide the atro@@ cities of the police which first shoots and then asks questions to cover up .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of the public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is said to be &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per State , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an extra part of Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia under@@ lines , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
one of these security policy measures was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has increasingly bombar@@ ded the poor communities against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux rec@@ ited from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also poses grave consequences for the people .
for this demands the state to use means and means typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio will continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : mas@@ ked Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region east Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack on chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled food through tunnels and control points .
due to the many years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in homes and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now attracts more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; famili@@ arity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have achieved more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds origin@@ ating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tank . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) to acquire new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many regional capitals in Portugal on October 21 and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ mp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died , and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for a period of 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite shots , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest have been burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ eeable trage@@ dies
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil defence was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the League of farmers in Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the wh@@ ale reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article from the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this species .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal was on 15 and 16 October , when residents were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the website counted more than half a million requests .

precisely at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , joined G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so then she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly res@@ cu@@ ed .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once more he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
at that time , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran behind him and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ il@@ ateral willingness to survive enabled A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af plu@@ cked his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and a fast food after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates there are about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans living in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of the Orient Experience restaurant where the wa@@ iters and the staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari in Pad@@ ua opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and return to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how they can sell their yields on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen report : Egypt &apos;s alleg@@ ations enable social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the ev@@ ac@@ uation of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament veri@@ fies a bill that stipul@@ ates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting their complete name and ID number on the authority &apos;s website .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the execution of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently present to the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another deputy filed a bill of legislation in which tough@@ er pun@@ ish@@ ments would be instit@@ uted to insul@@ t the president or to a senior official .
under the legislation of the law , such action would , however , be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , it may mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen , while violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in detention for a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , floo@@ ding , inter alia , weapons ownership , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in Gi@@ za called the two journalist H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si meeting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to document le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly questioned by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , backed a controversial draft bill that would assure business@@ men and officials accused of corruption under the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ law@@ fully received money .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined to mention Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , in the District Court of Tunis on 0@@ 9th May , he appeared as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity card ?
according to the new regulations of the information bure@@ au of the National Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in sub@@ assemblies within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these rules to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or We@@ Chat failed to register as &quot; organis@@ er of the dis@@ semination of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organise the publication of information . moreover , the government also allows the government to charge said services for removing content and comp@@ el them on request to deliver user data .
these web pages include websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ clas@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the mail service mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as blocking in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators have refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was closed because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source collabor@@ ating with groups to fom@@ ent a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
UK can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor and install communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services relating to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
