<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very cautious love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops with his mind behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people reacted to his statements and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominised by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that welcomed people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who lives the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump is paving his way to nominate Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note d. Ü): as much as "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities"; word play from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones named, has just killed what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyans, whose story, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans find a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would someone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And my heart breaks me.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What's the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music banger) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and bane violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hustle and bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">The children of Cateura are playing more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made up of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an orchestra consisting of instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens under an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the waters of Liberian waters before it searched the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized themselves against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is not regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail tempo, with the information circulated between individual countries, the actions now take place in real time, traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to label ships that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious cycle routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports on the basis of this information. what does this mean that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishment, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there is a considerable financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, declarations of imagination, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "target the missing international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You must not run my harbor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole is now trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information. it aims to help FISH-i find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform, together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization, a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who where to do - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had fished without license earlier and had little to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i are now seeing a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats have been purchasing more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces there, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also combating illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH. "" safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to announce its first great triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license, and used trawl nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship has also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative work to protect the oceans works across the world ocean.

<seg id="152">Their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela is sharpening further: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "regaining the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="155">This image of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected Venezuela's application for a referendum on a referendum, Venezuelans reacted, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went to the void while gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against it can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also held in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes-regions Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal Karabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily routine of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicolás Maduro; in the end, however, the reluctance of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes in her latest article the context of government resolution as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine is, the referendum on ministerial exercise was the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called on the demonstrators to join forces on 27 October to support the National Assembly. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, should continue to persist for the removal of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strikes and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most often shared images shows a demonstrator calling through the shields: "will you kill me because I am hungry?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that talk about confrontations, as well as reports of repression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean state of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round, which forms the scale of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ministerial procedural procedure - this has now been proved in the eyes of many people on the road by the presence of countless people.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs about this:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado claim that 1% of signatures have been falsified.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your ministerial exercise!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others are analyzing these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which, from their point of view, has done little against the devastating economic crisis and prefers to mute critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches are increasing frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview with Luis Quijano, published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial ended on 24 August 2016 investigating crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis was not a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was the Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Records of the archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone called it "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine, because my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy papers which had listened to the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I peaked in and saw a couch tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation error to a centre in Kyoto, where you can extend your driving licence.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was disseminated in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Kyoto town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which they can extend their driving licence have been witnesses of a particularly miserable translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield, the Japanese word was also falsely invented in the Japanese word (koreidossha), which means "older motorists," falsely - but perhaps also with malicious hind-thoughts & # 8212; as "dreadful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edited the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is in Kyoto, is saying:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could such an English translation come?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate, although not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News dealt a bit more extensively with the phenomenon of the "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents is quite a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors convicted 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">As a result, their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The named Reporter published in the version of the article published on Yahoo, showing what prejudices some Japanese apparently leapt to older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on the translation error in Yahoo received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "-" "" "Is the (" "" "terrible car" "" ") not the reality?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "-" "" "So erroneous is the translation really not, isn't it?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, who could translate the translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves leave translations in-house translations. then the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The phrases and enigmatic sentences created by machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often adorn T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable to jewelry or at least harmless. however, from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more thorough translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">Hopefully the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reputable source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also took photographs of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was snapped and recommended that users use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>

<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsincintro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online broadcasters. this also applies to the website on which the National Assembly transmits its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web page is blocked by DNS, the server replies erroneous or refuses to respond when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elapoligov, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third screened channel, was discontinued on Thursday 6th April when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests to Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went to show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates internet connections, making the Venezuelan access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay many girls will become slaves to get an education</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a child of a Criadite. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "today, Tina fights for the rights of children and raises testimonies of other Criadians who have been victims of abuse and discrimination." ""</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abridged version of a report from a structural member published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, there are more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money handed over their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadians - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude inoculated by the Criadians guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, which is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes care of the girl and justifies its exploitation by faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the hidden in Paraguayan households was given a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent strikes. she died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadite in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Population Register Office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadite.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF and Callescuela were responsible for the practice of Criadazgo, deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people gathered in protest and called for" "" "no further Carolina" "" "in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," "" "said Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadite.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo is coming to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadite</seg>
<seg id="455">The cries are not only exploited as labour force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farsi, in which her father worked, had to sign in bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all of them and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share time so that she had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school ended, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was ready with learning the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make supper for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the partisans Liberal, a liberal party, who during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989, belonged to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings, the host Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "while he was intelligent, he did not entertain himself with her." "" "the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they often didn't allow me to visit my family because they thought I would get" "" "bad habits" "" "there again." "" "so they thought that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaraní, would return home to Guaraní." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was absolutely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which almost never was spoken is bullying and harassment that Criadians are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadite.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody home. I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">Society endorses Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaners and nurses in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The group's administrator is Pepa Kostianovsky, a city councillor in the Asunción district.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="484">To learn.</seg>
<seg id="485">Please contact us.</seg>
<seg id="486">Starting from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the site Ñemby wrote that she had an eleven-year-old girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">"" "another woman who also came from Ñemby offered her 15 year old niece." "" "she likes small children and is very pretty," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="490">"" "the third commentary was written by" "" "a girl from the homeland who wants to work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the author of the ad turned out again:</seg>
<seg id="492">Dear friends, I have found one. I think if it works with it.</seg>
<seg id="493">Thank you very much, I write again when something is.</seg>
<seg id="494">The business was completed.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the prologue to the report Criadians, ¿hasta cubindo?</seg>
<seg id="496">(Criadians, how long?), a collection of testimonies of former Criadians, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history we managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay, where the Spanish conquistadores, the Conquistadores, the wives of the Guaraní) and the native population (where the workers were treated as semi-slaves) and the system of the Mensú (where the workers were treated as semi-slaves) and that they become easy victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of non-governmental organization Nature are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the bigger family of leopards, which roam through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1.000 animals, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular way of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza is passionately showing a different side of her country, which is not just about war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of "Nature Iraq" for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and is still occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was an etched prefecture in northeastern Japan that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had let whole coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture did not yet have an atomic accident, and already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">Residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (in the Netherlands) were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of temporary accommodation (the state-of-the-art, casetsu jute aku) is still trying to resettle in final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, still 360,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Evacuated Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were living after the disaster in temporary shelters, were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have reopened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 percent of the fishery ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the nuclear lock zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants think it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how her feeling changed vis-à-vis the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more information about tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents are finding that there is still not enough done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 displaced people from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima living outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. they are known to retire in proper dwellings because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When you meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that a more connecting than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="592">Brazilian activist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations</seg>
<seg id="593">Left: the attack against Mateus Ferreira da Silva. photo: Luiz da Luz. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva in a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer struck him with a strike against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now translated it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás reported that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation into the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits Goiânia with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer shouted by a demonstrator and land on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media activist from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics rushed to him shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also dipped in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, which lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police violence. "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing was divided several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. published with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado sends further attacks against activists in Goiás in memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás has experienced a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was killed by his father, because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group joined forces just to criminalize teachers, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a stick.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police handgrips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police action against demonstrators took place last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">At protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, police officers used rubber bullets and tear gas in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for speakers.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, the Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have squandered street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustratively shape their front pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane as over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">You must also recognize this if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police is covered by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Cuba's Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers in Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as the el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period of time are in operation again because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically deprecated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per Pound, issued according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Prospects" issued by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation (FAO).</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro attending the sugar factory in Lavandero on 21 October 2002." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories came to a standstill, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as known as a soldier, speaks about the closing of the factory, is the word he repeats most," "" "fraud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began before the first closing year.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents that would only be distinguished regarding the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was overcrowded and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, awaits the retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the shutdown of the factory, in which he helped to build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">Cuba's best developed industrial sector and the most important workplace has been extinguished.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this using Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants learn topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumeb First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section in Western Canada where nearly two dozen young women were murdered or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and go forward with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator has decreed</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contributes a contribution and adds the verse in syllables (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the reception shokuhin sanitu (the "plastic models of the dishes") are exhibited by each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is now turning them into showy phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpurple.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic ribbons as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyo department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food have been turned into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shocues fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in Essentials is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an awning-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">We found a good use as a mobile phone for this triangular bowl (lol).</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also manufactured this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile phone with laughing? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more quirky plastic dishes you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # in the way to add-in to the administation.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in foreign and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the misgists and diderers regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who are involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime cannot only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vigique Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear lives" "" ") narrates these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have placed to go and search for tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my ten-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "rebellious" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. of Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family has been plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminal records money from their business month by month, until they end up not only destroying the business, but also torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never fades, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, prepare potatoes, prepare tortillas and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 murders.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to show the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tortured the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The factcheck is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what about the years after something has emerged the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used to manipulate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology from Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people who watched the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses rusted and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>

<seg id="831">"" "a picture entitled" "" "This is Nigeria" "". "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized bodies that are lined up on the ground while persons looking at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was put up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 combatants of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were lying in streets and shrubs.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent feud between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo showed up again, when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misinterpretations; Africa Check has documented ordinances for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example mistakenly put the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who could flee could hit blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against Rohingya, posts like the following report, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which falsely claimed to be the president of Myanmar's Than being, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news site falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein Sein in 2012 admitted that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from Sange.</seg>

<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre (and retards more than 9,300 times), but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "there are dozens of people with social media who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of mis- and falsehood suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and it insults the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been discussed in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. at times these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used by the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of wrong attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world which are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you will find for example words from the Taxes language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- get tired of your parents in recognition of how you have been striving for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after having been warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal different thought processes and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="973">More than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rain falls on Saturday (27 May), and the water levels in some areas slowly returned.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They abdicate me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't look all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit in there, are demuscled.</seg>

<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are brought and people by creating the "other" in public performance, was even scientific at Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of deliberately and unconsciously the "other"; as my girlfriend and I in the rain did during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, bombarded chocolate cake, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to that.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the feasibility of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to often with it is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to appreciate, feel, link." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation lead to the fact that the audience listens to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyamara is asked: "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organisers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started at the Dominican Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civic Front for the Neural Test of the debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reorganization of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, was dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house published within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective reflection).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available free of license, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book titled "Collective Remembrance" gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as an insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia plays a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototyping was more predictive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the waymark of numerous civilisations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not yet able to know that ten years after he began working with the work, the IS would put everything in place, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel couldn't complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology for me. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding any of them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prostitute who wrote her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organization Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director of Corruption caused by corruption charges again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison term in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Divoino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the disembezzlement of 54 million metics (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of the Mozambique airports whose advice was held by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which took place on April 19th.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not carry any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we are aware of is that the company should also have instituted a disciplinary action against the contrary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company was silent, however, and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "" "" "egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambian social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after being sentenced to prison and half of which had been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">A disgusting thing!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state had already massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morale and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served only himself on the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become weary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are in prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all, including the Fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>

<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts out of the net because it contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting dices), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post by one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase" "" "ku la -" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet thought that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical before releasing any posts that would be suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words on the next page.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age brackets).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all those who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't correspond to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author stated his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned such words as "chair" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese sites." ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code-based initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements seeking to abolish child marriage laws followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "for example, a Hindu leader had no concerns to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they should," "" "take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill in general.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - in spite of 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously been approved by the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled, because the laws on child marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which has concealed the core of the thing, but you know what? toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is almost worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it took quite a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentro-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says: News, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that spoke quite openly about the importance of adopting the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The aged age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years, regardless of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the change of the marriage network was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "all deputies who agreed have voted for the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">In Trinidad and Tobago, the children's marriage is no longer allowed by law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...)</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who fought it.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Yet a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Samuel Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to be able to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris al rawi, advocate of the law, argued that it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrelay suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear TV, if we think instead of talking so broadly, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply talk about the state that our daughters are preventing them from being abused by large, hard-boiled males who are facing them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page on Wikipedia was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally blackened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular Wikipedia-based encyclopedia on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resisted the locking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked sites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as recently posted in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (# 5651) was passed.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated) are now submerged.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. hosts computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names, making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, however, accessible in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Once we have heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything to take snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and fellow worker at the Panigrahi's Open Speak podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if it is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A looking rhinoceros, chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with himself and to try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how this prime location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was at home just when Navarre was suddenly called me (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river, a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood before face to face with face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buster appeared. he immediately sits down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the indian State Odisha by a false tribunal and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not to mention in the name is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer justifications to be feared, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, became a unique club and became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years, Rohini Pais has been working with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion round acted by women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open a conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to mention the names of their husbands, is a custom that they all dutifully upheld and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home at home.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him on his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "patriarchy" "" "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they all asked," "" "If we can't tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a century-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only kicked in front of her; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In the adrenalin rush about having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put on the women: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead, showing the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zinapex-red dot if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place to exchange views and opinions.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every point of discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what to hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they happen to occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a sage courtta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of its own dress code, the moral connection with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggle their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion, Rohini affirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but stopped saying the name of her husband again.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rushing for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"" "these stories are" "" "messages from those who experience it themselves" "", "and offer a hyperlocal context in order to report on global human rights and development challenges." ""</seg>
<seg id="1546">The first Japan visit of the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a commemorative day</seg>
<seg id="1547">The Beatles at their landing in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1548">Screenshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29 this year, the hashtag was the most important part of the Japanese Twitter trend, whereby many fans exchanged memories and shared their esteem for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The Beatles visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this has been enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here quickly became aware that they had no choice at all than to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning!! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in the English classes of Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles of the Beatles survived all.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to be John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, of course Japanese make pilgrimages to the known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In case you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you definitely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies use the fan base in terms of market technology, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">I will listen to Yesterday today and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya.</seg>
<seg id="1579">So the day is going to run today.</seg>
<seg id="1580">So, we hope you are there!</seg>
<seg id="1581">Follow the hashtag, the chasphy of the chanting, to learn more about the Beatles memorial day.</seg>

<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mordecabala, province of Zambézia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head had power, generating the riches.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017, at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital because of liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (endangerment) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an "internal affair," and a spokesman says that he considered it "not necessary to discuss it with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Germany and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer any questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon exports to China since exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called on China for the release of Lius, as stated in an announcement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy summoned a furious response from China, with the statement of the State Department that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as to international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing to Reuters news agency that China had great concerns, whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and the United States</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu with adequate health care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police were always monitoring the room in hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact anyone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those who are involved in the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, Germany and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments it needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France would eventually record it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan wholesaler distributor</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan asked China on June 27 to release Liu and show a greater tolerance to those who advocate peaceful remedies for political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislators, Yu Mei-nu, of the ruling democracies, also called on China to allow the sick intellectuals to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in an explanation on June 28 at Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, undersigned Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Association of Lawyers of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of that, he seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns perpetually led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre will appear again by the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given by Shanmugam during the last week were really non-answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He was able to disguise corresponding questions with non-answers in a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements made by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country, he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard who expects me - do I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that, properly associates and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Herr Shanmugam" "" "commit a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian advocate?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the cabinet, the statements made by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur afford their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"" "the magazine" "" "Journey of a Decade" "" "tends to affirm, Singapore is and has always been a city:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many of the people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly against anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little difference between Americans and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things happening around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a leading part of the Canadian.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodies the Junta who took power in 2014, and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video indirectly relates to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "possibly refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision-making over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also set up in the army to monitor the online content and prosecute people accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand implements a strict" "" "Lese Majeste" "" "(Majestic Atmosphere)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59th year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacles frame and gold coloured ear rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">There is a parrot in the vestibule in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have been sleeping outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys medicines they can't pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Michelet, a Guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that the Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his workplace from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the home of Mama Afrika everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travelers hear calmly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair lichen, which she has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she imagines her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app is" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, implemented by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with underage filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often categorize extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the media outlet" "" "Images from mainland China" "", "which was based on Twitter, published the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police polled the inhabitants randomly, whether they had installed the surveillance app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (German) also published a Jingwang product description which shows that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, the computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental branches, public authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Urumqi's regional capital to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action infringes the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or bad to be punished, although I did nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure yourself with him and you cannot withhold your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him yet, so they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>

<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he hurries to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felloyees (e.g.: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientations, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria until the very end of Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not constrained by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the "Palestinian refugee of the second generation" - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a human being" "" "while he shakes in water soluble Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has some weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose actually speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry Jordaniens has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicting the country's cultural and traditional norms, and the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MEPs and former spokeswoman in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahbout said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which questioned the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "who continue to advocate an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement would probably not simply be a shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch all the way to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of "Ehrenmassacres" has taken place in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a ban on crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence can "indefinitely be held in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from issues that were regarded as taboo in his country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate from politics his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was inscribed in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are political in the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words," "" "what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later point out that his comments are torn, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only one edited version was streamed," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who was later to work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not be able to do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news agency set up several former government decrees and members of the teacher association, arguing that they have expressed criticism of the problems related to the corruption deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is constant giving and taking. Jordan has now led Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the aid of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and democratically-led democracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until this time, Hdaib will continue to tow and resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festivals which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of West Japan invaded the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissushi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are currently visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, Nebuta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of an 18 meter high tower was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearances and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these sophisticated hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts oppose each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools instead of obtaining a training in the hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of her achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel alienated?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question that the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Bogotart Foundation and Cristian Palacios were no longer inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write guerrilla fighters letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos for his merits was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before Colombians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now enter their ranks and support them in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to come together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed most urgent attention this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for ex-fighters of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN stores in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogoto Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC introduced themselves as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters filled with support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "nevertheless I addressed him and said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I will answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran to me about the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">"" "" "" "I hugged him, and set me beside the pomegranates." ""</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the outset, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC operated already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing those people who haven't yet found hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarming peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to weapons, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had everything to say and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right pulmonary wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for respectfully converting with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some perfectly unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me that I must prove it by running up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster that has not only shamed your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It became too much for my mother and she lay a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time I realized that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional cascasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I desire, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not close a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has been experienced by blood recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men trapped in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to settle Kadyrows' judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know they are held there, so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they attacked some village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, but dipped specifically in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new about them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, so far there have been no reports. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have been allowed for these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known all over Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to bring us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately it was thrown back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored lashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia never touched me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea vessels, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not spend a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I sabotaged breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to tell you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestaner have which, the cabardiners have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in transitioning to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide inside the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong rise in suicide for the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The suicide of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, according to Ahrazi's human rights groups who would like to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ahrazi minority in August, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have been hanging.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab forefathers suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where much of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran is based, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab AAhraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, famine, and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a multiplicity of dams that divert water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to exacerbate the devastation caused by dryness and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Awarzi young people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahrazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed a secondary school, and 45% have completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohii, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist residing in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">For this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is due to a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not pretend to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation with the Ahrazi and to be employed, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the circumstances that the Arabic Ahrazi has to endure, human rights activists strike an alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is preventable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zurichand was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later meet in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am suffering twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I'm a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I get to talk on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been abused with racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to institutionalized forms of racist-motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which refers both to gender and to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, in her speech," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical way a bad and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of cutting skin color and gender. some of them will continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which has been called into life for my dark skin and status as a woman, so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanities: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and marginalisation after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Ctural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# soflicheinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector Ada Báez said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship some time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files, but you can't do more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed for misuse, Ada Báez's clear ad also benefited nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned her advert.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women make a refund at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit that they are victims of violence, reporting to the prosecution authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Strikes and Statistical 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system that doesn't interfere with the 3 Paraguayan laws: good approach, faulty implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are several indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay" she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were 9600 ads on domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the Courts of Peace. here, too, 86% of women's advertisements came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want that, but then she gave up.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer associated with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I was going to be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report abuses by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming her name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not even mentioned in the media. it is a growing region that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines missing in the global healthcare sector that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more serious in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and missing investments for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDR).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being the makers of himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Q: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people coming back or coming here because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Q: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in relation to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodicals make articles only accessible against payment (the so-called paywall), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com webpage, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only set by its own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of salad it can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the early 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green shade or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or carrots. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still cultivates salad, but now he needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's as if in a river there are a boulder around which I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement growing in the US and all over the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Römersalat of the type Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station, where it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement originates from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately to sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the ability to breed new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers rights, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes care of the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples are being offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed available to others, as opposed to patent seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all of the carton features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders either at all or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are patenting on a larger scale than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted features - from those through which their taste or color improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is decreasing for breeders by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the modified conditions are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company advocates the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property implies other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Therefore, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but also promotes them by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: wait 20 years until a patent expires, certainly not support innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to facilitate their work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what motivates us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">On the whole, Morton is bothered by the concept of patenting plant attributes: "we don't really create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants are formed by themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi member of the board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who cultivates a variety, also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce large quantities of herbicides, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such which move to international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) patents, they manage to survive the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they lean the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads at his breeder garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy to do. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the U.S. seems to be leading in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre cooperates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organisation" "" "Agree" "" "is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation can not simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks out against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "an explanation is not yet a law; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos "program for" open source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for" open source "seed systems for which the official launch is expected to fall in schedule next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true - in spite of this attack and the spotting of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago, including the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar for alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures has fallen victim. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for web pages and media not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censor apparatus of the Egyptian government was the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Bloggers, the provider of which also gives a home to Zidas blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although blocking the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempt to kill, summons to the National Security Council, blocked blogs and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked sites from 24 May to 06 August 133. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented providers blocked by internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that might have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Newspapers in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs, report day after day.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "thieves bolden pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, navy and airstream to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the force of violence in Rio has reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO, Global Justice, even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the magazine" "" "Extra" "" "known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio released the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crime, etc. whatever happens in Rio, will be published in the "War in Rio" section. (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we, as journalists, do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">"" "" "" "extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war of war in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when distorted, can also be used to hide the atrocities of the police which first shoots and then asks questions to cover up.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira is arguing that violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is said to be "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per State, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is an extra part of Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília underlines, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these security policy measures was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a Favela by deploying massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has increasingly bombarded the poor communities against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux recited from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also poses grave consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this demands the state to use means and means typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding land, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region east Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack on chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or smuggled food through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the many years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as "food-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in homes and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now attracts more and more" "" "familiarity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have achieved more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the shortage of fuel, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said" "" "Global Voices" "" "said that they began with the" "" "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tank. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi throughout Eastern Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many regional capitals in Portugal on October 21 and demanded justice for the victims of the fires rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died, and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for a period of 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, there was a similar tragedy in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite shots, around 500,000 hectares of forest have been burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil defence was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the League of farmers in Portugal explained the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "in the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the roads were closed very late." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the whale reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "" "" "the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall, if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," "" "João Sorval continues in the same article from the newspaper Público." ""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread after fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal was on 15 and 16 October, when residents were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand the onslaught of 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the website counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once more he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran behind him and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quotas, but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "special centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unilateral willingness to survive enabled Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf plucked his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he opened a second hostel and a fast food after a while.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was presented for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates there are about 20,000 Afghans living in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghans have emerged, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of the Orient Experience restaurant where the waiters and the staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari in Padua opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs targets, however, extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and return to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "this is how they can sell their yields on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: Egypt's allegations enable social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, protesting against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament verifies a bill that stipulates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting their complete name and ID number on the authority's website.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or the execution of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently present to the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another deputy filed a bill of legislation in which tougher punishments would be instituted to insult the president or to a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislation of the law, such action would, however, be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, it may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen, while violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in detention for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, flooding, inter alia, weapons ownership, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza called the two journalist Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of the pro-Morsi meeting block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the penalties of the journalist Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists to document leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly questioned by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, backed a controversial draft bill that would assure businessmen and officials accused of corruption under the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unlawfully received money.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia declined to mention Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, in the District Court of Tunis on 09th May, he appeared as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity card?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the information bureau of the National Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in subassemblies within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only selectively enforce these rules to protect citizen journalism and independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "then do we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor WeChat failed to register as "organiser of the dissemination of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organise the publication of information. moreover, the government also allows the government to charge said services for removing content and compel them on request to deliver user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages include websites like Vcontacts and Odnoclasniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the mail service mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedias blocking in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators have refused to clear two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was closed because it became" "" "an information source collaborating with groups to foment a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">UK can't stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor and install communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services relating to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until the 19th of May. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
