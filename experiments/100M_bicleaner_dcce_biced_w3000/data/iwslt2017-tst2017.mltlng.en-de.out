that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before one heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published a spectacular report that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally owned tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb to Iran .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has been struggling against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy journalists .
according to the first constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish confidential information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
thus Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison from 2007 to 2015 .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had given years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to tears .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of distingu@@ ishing and spl@@ itting , that could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his phone calls secret ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit return , and even travel reports with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to judge Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ king supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that still hasn &apos;t existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmitting system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , like the one shown here by the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any regular contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset .
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must ensure that not only technology scientists , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have an opportunity to kill mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who warns alarm of the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street in@@ sider who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and mighty &#91; huge sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has mail@@ boxes in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be lots of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next un@@ disclosed documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that concern us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few to hide their fortun@@ es and veil -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people see this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always present it to me like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ del doll .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these schemes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have been no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
frau@@ d@@ sters are allowed to rip off particularly suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all up to one lawyer asked our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers contacted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very evil , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that a lot has begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has captured in central registers at a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind it .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see these Panama le@@ aks , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do @-@ firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy rising up and saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sales outlet .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , star@@ ing at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock up there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , slept on the to@@ e tips to the door and closed my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me during childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let us take a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into having fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when visiting .
on the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but she did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you ins@@ ist on things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your locked cell phone to your left neighbour .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
that is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who has Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he has been candidates for the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments , which all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked cell@@ phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system will strengthen confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to abandon negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we trust people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have fewer than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation qui@@ ties together com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is depend@@ ant on how much you get rid of yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m going on vacation with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on what topics one should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , there is a need that hasn &apos;t been met beforehand .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction had ever had a problem .
for people trusted each other rightly .
when confidence works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his evaluation :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they do not want one to feel lonely , they pass books .
they can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with monetary transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it &apos;s just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what would be , if in any place one visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would arrange flats for one another from the ground ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a residence ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children had moved out .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even a host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it has been taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing we realized that with the components of confidence one can find the right design .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives me past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ te me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , and to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later , I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people ran out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock suddenly turned into indignation .
why should one do such thing ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; , ... &quot; Middle East ... , ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the acts of others turned me into a susp@@ ecting one .
the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA in order to move to a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I was going sil@@ ently -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ay not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims to open and beat them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
I got the people angry at the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry also .
it is not easy to constantly explain oneself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually hear people saying : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
there is only one question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is observed only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces free , but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant look at people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , it is found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from the faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inary world when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups asser@@ t their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had planned to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised it a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que forbi@@ d her to join the IS .
this was an idea of how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more accepting an author@@ itarian system of governance , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if you submit messages that have neg@@ atively been reported to Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
in the allocation of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ h was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the Dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was astonished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot only be im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , as half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had learned courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you so much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what to say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m as usual as it is allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the biggest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billi@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with ropes .
connecting flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ pull structures .
they have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it has to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft engine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions , which penetrate the core of the matter .
for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts to join in to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ holi@@ er , the mechanically simplest remotely operated flight unit . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when I see all is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ a is an exercise in car@@ el@@ essness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
through this he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rotating .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let &apos;s see it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half un@@ f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed one another in a very far distant gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars along in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ camp life was created on earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is at home -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the launch of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes tra@@ ded through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my father @-@ sick father .
in essence , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gravit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o @-@ meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a ru@@ ff@@ ling in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ ole into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often perform a really cool dance in courses referring to the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretching and spra@@ ying , stretching and spra@@ ying . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ cken at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . so one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be accurately measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text on gravity
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott loves to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we transform wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has worked very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same pair of p@@ ant@@ lers with an additional key change . that sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear it recognis@@ es as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as quickly as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this road we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars are explo@@ ding in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail light .
with gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things that we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they are observing , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the sour bones , so to speak , for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the happ@@ enings in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we eman@@ ate from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories , a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was eliminating my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I always bo@@ thered to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir up your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running consec@@ u@@ tively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows I created myself , and not only produced , so still in top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take a shop or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not only playing around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as if you want a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could drive for ever on it .
many people accept when I explain to them the sum that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I began working with television production when I started working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive other than for size .
the feeling of not being able to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called sum@@ ming .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is a genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , over@@ stressed , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ tr@@ ants .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz stopped .
the bu@@ zz of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked out weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan doesn &apos;t sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showing Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l thyself , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you simply love someone else and that &apos;s a bu@@ zz@@ ing when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing once you &apos;ve known the bu@@ zz , who &apos;s you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things become aware of me :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I am titanium and my bu@@ zz@@ ing smo@@ kes , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except fitting .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl lets go in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door is approaching and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe my brain with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the pleasure .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current coming from the z@@ est of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be imposed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can rid myself of all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the h@@ um again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as good as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work as home at the workplace .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better working than being at home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
not one of them is that I &apos;m too relaxed .
we move around in the garden , in front and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take care of my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ vely , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , you don &apos;t need it anymore .
everyone can get up to 15 minutes a day , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children will finish .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the tot@@ em , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I divor@@ ce and I &apos;m victorious . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself to full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it enti@@ ces me to new ideas .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
bubble and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
that is now my bu@@ zz .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who will travel to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country I created , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , persistent , naked and new feeling of living in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I get you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you so much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical steps .
they certainly have one of the most famous ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with cran@@ ial trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is gra@@ b@@ bing the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save lives , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to make cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials , Jean @-@ François was able to do it .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we therefore saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then mark the color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the final step we re @-@ instit@@ uted it at the outlet point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ port these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ import the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we reim@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we last in the motor cor@@ tex the motor motor field .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recovered to some extent , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you can see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
see now , as we reim@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting with these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable entity .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- a finance minister in the Euro@@ group un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made it clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for a real democracy .
I be@@ g you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mil@@ ked , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the United States , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to wealthy savers and corporations , but they are too anxi@@ ous to invest where it would be productive and revenue , with which one could bear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the U.S. , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es it to the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the common market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , reinfor@@ ces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus &apos;s father , who fears that his son would kill him when he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the killing of O@@ edi@@ pus .
this is my rowing with capitalism --
his most extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the saving of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive aspect of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which allowed them to grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in matters of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy has not lasted for a long time --
like a candle shining brigh@@ tly , it is burnt out quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a ruling for rulers .
for the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , there was a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two by gradually under@@ mining the policy and dis@@ ma@@ yed them .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because power has mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which it eats , that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , the economy , which has so far @-@ can@@ ni@@ zed politics , is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality is rising , the general economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s , &quot; the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : aboli@@ shing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automati@@ zation lets the twin peaks become higher , the extravag@@ ance of subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ organise the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of business and politics , and make sure that we will democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring of hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the sense of life indul@@ ged .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the field of companies : please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially against the background of a unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time the liberal in which it fav@@ ors privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , Key@@ nesi@@ an international .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what to keep from the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar today to the England of the 19th century .
because -- let us remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill
he was very scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to present China now to do what the West did in the 19th century sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say good @-@ bye to us , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive stag@@ gering line was passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a minister of finance or a minister who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has not made any mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that passed through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of the len@@ ders imposed on this policy stood up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 that it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most people have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is rated at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not care to turn on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he has more thoughts about the medium coverage , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t inspire them .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch for free .
and if Amazon lets out things for free , do you pick it up , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
you are being watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process it and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find such a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have watched the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows of what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data versi@@ zed firms .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 Years of Statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it optimi@@ zes it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one will ever come into contact with this software in this room . come in touch with it , you &apos;re in jail .
if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not discharge takes place .
just as with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis they can predict influ@@ xes of influ@@ enza , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the most know@@ led@@ geable firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data is visi@@ bly flowing into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have identified a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . however , the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data say to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will do it later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know naturally , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much smar@@ ter than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball gets smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you so much .
