<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before one heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published a spectacular report that the NSA illegally owned telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over drafts for a nuclear bomb to Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has been struggling against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus Risen lived with the risk of going to prison from 2007 to 2015.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had given years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to tears.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of distinguishing and splitting, that could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his phone calls secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit return, and even travel reports with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risking supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that still hasn't existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmitting system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, like the one shown here by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any regular contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that endanger all of us." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we must ensure that not only technology scientists, such as Edward Snowden, have an opportunity to kill misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>

<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak in history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and mighty [huge sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailboxes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be lots of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next undisclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that concern us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by a few to hide their fortunes and veil -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people see this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it to me like a Matryodel doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these schemes.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle that these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters are allowed to rip off particularly susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to one lawyer asked our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers contacted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very evil, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured in central registers at a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see these Panama leaks, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy rising up and saying:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this type of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally finish the intransparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sales outlet.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the corps of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to end up in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I rock up there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed, slept on the toe tips to the door and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me during childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into having fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you insist on things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your locked cell phone to your left neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">That is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he has been candidates for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments, which all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked cellphones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system will strengthen confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to abandon negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation quities together commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependant on how much you get rid of yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great works of art in your apartment! I'm going on vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on what topics one should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, there is a need that hasn't been met beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction had ever had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want one to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with monetary transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it's just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if in any place one visited, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would arrange flats for one another from the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships, instead of solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children had moved out.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it has been taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that with the components of confidence one can find the right design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives me past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga singing, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to oute me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, and to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and finally believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>

<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people ran out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock suddenly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam...",... "Middle East...,..." jihad... "... bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu, the acts of others turned me into a suspecting one.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA in order to move to a new city and begin the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I was going silently -- as deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "" "Be vigilant," "" "be careful," "" "Remain in well lit areas," "" "Say not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims to open and beat them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the people angry at the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry also.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually hear people saying: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only one question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is observed only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces free, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant look at people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it is found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from the faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginary world when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups assert their ideology in their" "" "holy book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when one looks at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "holy scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had planned to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised it a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque forbid her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an idea of how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more accepting an authoritarian system of governance, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if you submit messages that have negatively been reported to Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swelled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the allocation of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deh was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the Dental Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when was such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, has murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot only be immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, as half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had learned courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you so much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what to say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble mindset, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">"" "" "" "I'm as usual as it is allowed." ""</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the biggest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billiard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1,500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-pull structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft engine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level, e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and therefore has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions, which penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts to join in to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying is working with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospholier, the mechanically simplest remotely operated flight unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when I see all is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospa is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Through this he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half unflightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopters -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there wants to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled one another in a very far distant galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit up brighter than all the stars along in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-camp life was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is at home -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the launch of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes traded through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my father-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational-waves from black holes and their through observatories as ligo-measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ruffling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stole into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturers often perform a really cool dance in courses referring to the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and spraying, stretching and spraying."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stricken at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. so one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured on less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott loves to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds it's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummer Bob." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we transform wave patterns into sound, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has worked very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same pair of pantlers with an additional key change. that sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrendes noise] Someone who knows what to hear it recognises as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as quickly as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars are exploding in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Big Bang is covered by its own tail light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things that we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo they are observing, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sour bones, so to speak, for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the happenings in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emanate from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories, a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "to which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of was eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life to an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kitten, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I always bothered to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, stir up your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running consecutively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows I created myself, and not only produced, so still in top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take a shop or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so you understand that I'm not only playing around on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you want a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could drive for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sum that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I began working with television production when I started working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive other than for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Reworked, overloaded, overstressed, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Sittens, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titrants.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked out weekends, no regrets, nothing delegating, a Titan doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showing Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul thyself, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're doing what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you simply love someone else and that's a buzzing when you know the buzzing once you've known the buzz, who's you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone more" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am titanium and my buzzing smokes, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except fitting.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl lets go in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is approaching and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sum, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe my brain with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "the sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific." ""</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current coming from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be imposed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can rid myself of all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as good as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work as home at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is better working than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">Not one of them is that I'm too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">We move around in the garden, in front and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take care of my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naively, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenage daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's just 15 minutes, you don't need it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get up to 15 minutes a day, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children will finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the totem, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I divorce and I'm victorious. meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not treat yourself to full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. it entices me to new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubble and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snuffing to me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who will travel to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country I created, the marathon I run, the troops, the screens, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right buzz: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, persistent, naked and new feeling of living in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think of things, I get you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing ability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical steps.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most famous ones, the "deep brain stimulation." an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with cranial trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is grabbing the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to make cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials, Jean-François was able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We therefore saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark the color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step we re-instituted it at the outlet point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimport these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-import the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplagued the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplagued exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we last in the motor cortex the motor motor field.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to some extent, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now, as we reimplagued the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting with these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- a finance minister in the Eurogroup unequivocally made it clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are milked, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the United States, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to wealthy savers and corporations, but they are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and revenue, with which one could bear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the U.S., England and the eurozone, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compares it to the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the common market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest. just like Oedipus's father, who fears that his son would kill him when he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances lead to the killing of Oedipus.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my rowing with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His most extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the saving of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive aspect of the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which allowed them to grant them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in matters of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy has not lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle shining brightly, it is burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our present liberal democracies don't have their roots in ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a ruling for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, there was a relentless struggle between the two by gradually undermining the policy and dismayed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because power has migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals from which it eats, that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, the economy, which has so far-cannized politics, is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality is rising, the general economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos," the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automatization lets the twin peaks become higher, the extravagance of sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reorganise the economy and reunite the sectors of business and politics, and make sure that we will democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring of hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations the sense of life indulged.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" matrix "similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially against the background of a unified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time the liberal in which it favors privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history, and Keynesian, Keynesian international.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what to keep from the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I can say this provocative, China is similar today to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- let us remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To present China now to do what the West did in the 19th century smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "that is to say good-bye to us, and the permanent denial that a massive staggering line was passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or a minister who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has not made any mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to fall, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that passed through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the lenders imposed on this policy stood up:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>

<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most people have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes itself on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "Game of Thrones" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care to turn on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He has more thoughts about the medium coverage, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon lets out things for free, do you pick it up, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are being watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you jump over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process it and hence the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find such a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have watched the available data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows of what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data versized firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 Years of Statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one will ever come into contact with this software in this room. come in touch with it, you're in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not discharge takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just as with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis they can predict influxes of influenza, the worst kind, by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most knowledgeable firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data is visibly flowing into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people inconceivably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have identified a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you basically do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do. however, the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "that's what the data say to us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will do it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know naturally, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much smarter than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball gets smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">At the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you so much.</seg>
