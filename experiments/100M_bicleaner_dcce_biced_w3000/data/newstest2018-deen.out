Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a mine chapel , now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former basis of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows this , who had to get upset , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavarian State Government , are anything but current - yet very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ I , which one does not recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called judgments , have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops re@@ treated with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , they were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian survey of surve@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was 21 years after drawing up the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 alongside today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original &quot; from which the Basic Tax has been derived .
small plots claim there today no more farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the facility &quot; Land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based Irish institute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was born there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the ank@@ le of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the staff from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients , first place was place , later was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar , 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ anism meet at the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .
West lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural terms of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ cement factory , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lied bom@@ b@@ ings broke many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel dating back to the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn regular route takes place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man Group publishes Travel@@ War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges African @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents occur throughout the state and are noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination , as well as the state enforcement authorities that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , led the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will be hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group quoted incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i State Office in which black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state will be hal@@ ted 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared to bring in ch@@ ewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime series of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further ra@@ cial benefits .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ bau@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U place association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the sle@@ wing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only region@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also chairman of B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t generate profit on such steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work , much has to be dealt with with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if it does not lead to organic farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy with the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the re@@ aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be dra@@ gged off for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced .
the open area covers 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ man .
thus the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture @-@ magic .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives , it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Science Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state grant of soft f@@ ences .
the objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveying backdrop referred to by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be protected should not be stri@@ pper@@ y ( slope climbing above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ men@@ bacher Wei@@ rd @-@ Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restrictions on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of ship owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ eers would have ly@@ ched him if he had done it .
but he took on the meaning , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller called A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is genu@@ inely correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it concerns the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; thy we@@ ary , thy poor , and thy oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable waste of thy abundant coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : the mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus altered the meaning of the statue , the right @-@ wing people wanted to change this for a long time .
the big writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across quite un@@ usually here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the viewpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ ful but hop@@ eful people after long and often dre@@ ad@@ ful journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever recognize .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong cont@@ ingent of the World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 to start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected as a team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that made E@@ ili@@ d@@ h quite natural were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ section runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man looking for a great season which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in the team was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Captain of the team says that they are &quot; immen@@ sely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they are also involved in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a big honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it simply will be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics over Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers sm@@ ashed it because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , for sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s Staff dis@@ missed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a back@@ lash with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to bust his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous by employees who are designated as officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what employees of the Gover@@ nor referred to as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated sp@@ amm@@ ing attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical clo@@ ths and to arrest and arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly that just happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question happened last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable account had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters boo@@ sted his leadership .
even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the Am@@ ity treaty , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European # 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days since the Renaissance Club organis@@ es the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open in East Lo@@ thi@@ an .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who in the past year led to the final round in the Arch@@ er@@ field left until he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player home to South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking annually , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of Study Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic in 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking annually in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ inger Straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as a lot of ic@@ eber@@ gs are hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which repeatedly imp@@ airs the construction work , is a big problem for the construction sector of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty stren@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ ment in the quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the carb@@ oni@@ zed tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with dirty water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which led to independence from the Dutch government , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta that maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea settled the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and corrugated sheets , which were converted into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these fortun@@ es , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful army retains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port numbers local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , nearly $ 20 million , among them up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been tor@@ tured , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as headquarters in the 1970 &quot; s were declared genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are losing everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Or@@ e dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese warning cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - ta@@ sted its market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President , J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals are che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ kil@@ i &apos;s inauguration in October , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had d@@ rank , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their ri@@ f@@ le bones , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so hard struck that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - continuously and a bird song im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began hur@@ ling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ se , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ la still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cous@@ in who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings took place on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical violations of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackl@@ ing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calling for more than 1,000 lives in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the dead , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police threw the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company , who refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to account for the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a Te@@ hr@@ an for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal families Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women capable of processing four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ il airport .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua seldom have capital or the necessary skills to bring their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the vice @-@ president of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Pap@@ ua is unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mum@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ers carried out a final symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried on a ground exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give them justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest living towers in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise building in just two years , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and shou@@ ting the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who called his name George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at a local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Union ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single on two gains was not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also therefore highly este@@ emed Five @-@ sentence @-@ classics were thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already come before the proposal to carry out the final on a neutral place .
as of 2018 , only comparatively minor details are : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey conducted by air passengers indicates that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously prohibited items passed on to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally wearing forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were late discovered that they had er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , which were members of the Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately caused by T@@ SA agents were foodstuffs and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated that they had deliberately borne things with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently taken s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled , know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly , carry it through safety , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with you or how much of them .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while , the people thought T@@ SA could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .

in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales growth and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k presented another , less brilliant number for the first time in announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly balance sheet : the cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has had more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders have already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations circul@@ ated in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines that are never tested in practice without any major interruption with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts have doubts that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , then the in@@ compatibility of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running out in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s delay to reduce emissions
a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government agencies than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline which expi@@ red on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of O@@ zone in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , for a long time was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or del@@ aying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it regulatory roll back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to meet dead@@ lines for execution and then been waiting to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EP@@ O said that P@@ ru@@ itt could at some point use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorization to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York settled in California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing difficulties in sensitive groups of people , and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for a sudden change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump Government to address environmental pol@@ lu@@ ters and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors of the 6th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful location .
the preservation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc a concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it &apos;s a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ Custom@@ buch . Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tum@@ lingen including the Vo@@ g@@ ur &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the deed , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a marvellous court which belonged to the church or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the most beautiful settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church right .
a gent@@ leman , who built a church and occupied it with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church bases , and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church were to be collap@@ sed in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ary was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was stopped .
in the spring of 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off .
only the tower @-@ d@@ warf still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius installation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc invite you to the 6th Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th , at the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ary chapel .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organizers the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to tum@@ ours and hearing @-@ dig@@ gers .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ arc feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini affir@@ ms .
association wants to have permission of wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the land council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there existed only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; as@@ par@@ agus &quot; of the landscape .
only a few days before , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided on a second wind power station zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette due to a change in the land use plan - but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted authorisation process remains un@@ lawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to leave the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out according to planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to check the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ hrt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of some 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ gel@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally injured .
two more people were slightly hurt .
the provincial road was closed for hours .
following police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the course of the accompanying ride with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and tra@@ der plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers about what offers their own city has in store away from the usual supermarket goods .
therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action does not only aim at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation there are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags indicating the action @-@ weekend , says Christian König .
the municipal administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the business association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re@@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city centre while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the inner city - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly wide @-@ spread , had told King in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian towns participate in the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his / her purchasing behaviour .

Tr@@ ump set up after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called for a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border dam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president insul@@ ted him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Gy@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; and that the existence on trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists adopt rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle trap - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence as a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them found a real si@@ gh in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress member of the state Georgia and a life long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the post @-@ ordination serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want completion , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician establishes a bed cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one has ever been accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open base for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .
about at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , fell during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and squ@@ ander@@ ed the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re @-@ production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to see , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors performed Dar@@ by Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es out and har@@ ms him , fur@@ ious that he slept with Dor@@ othy with his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a dream of mour@@ ning stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and seduc@@ es Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice is breaking with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have seen Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ s@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels cu@@ dd@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to inspect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks up their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ ope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona re@@ alizes two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience will sit together with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white couple from Atlanta ch@@ ats about the delivery with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which emotion left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do what they do because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s court stops at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is inspir@@ ational in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf places a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; bust and Ela@@ bar &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers pose as rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that goes through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhine @-@ daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
K@@ ES@@ S mis@@ lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , t@@ ore a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ ram@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when Siegfried &apos;s shot .
later even Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and bowed his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated in a stor@@ my way .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a g@@ ellen@@ istic pipe concert , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one real@@ ises that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of their view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year at several places .
where to go anywhere ?
quantity : usually in stone in the furniture exchange , once a week I am working here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide range I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I made a high school .
and then a civil engineer study , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is a fal@@ seh@@ ood for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , as there is an insight , you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector during the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , I &apos;m going to have a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunte@@ ering service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing his FS@@ J .
one can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support .
for me it was exactly the right thing that provoked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating the extras .
you always have other people in mind , who each have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a young person from the family has been taken out of the family - you have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son falls to another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme is started to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job reduction , announced by the General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year is unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter have been viol@@ ated , announced a NATO Declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops crushed the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan because US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , under which States are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone rules 2015 , &quot; and said it is the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and remember that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in order to establish where inc@@ isions must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ back of the Democrats and the conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O website states that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Council of F@@ aul@@ orn decides to set up a common space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it may take a while until the area is owned by the church community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
for this there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council lev@@ it@@ ates such a common area not to be seen as a meeting place just for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical housing , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget will be missed by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common space would be so reported by T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this regard there is no bil@@ let between the legs , the determination that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as an optional pit@@ ched roof - which would reduce the pitch and make the construction more economical - possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
if it helps : it is unanim@@ ous that it passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of his own buildings , with which one does not move so well , but now you lean back to the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m having a hard time with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy on wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter@@ value that is market@@ able in case of doubt , the opposite is .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to propose the proposed resolutions accordingly finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; when we hold the decision , we make a giant leap forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : cycli@@ st is shot on street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured and severely injured in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath .
as the police told , the 82 @-@ year Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path along the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the street , he obviously did not pay attention to the return traffic .
he met with a car which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retention car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 am / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel take care of the German football record champion Bayern München .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with BV@@ B .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed that on Friday .
the mou@@ th@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official match of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
wander@@ ing in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to develop in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the information needs of many visitors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception is playing a role in selecting the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars had different colors or why a star was stronger than another , even though it was much far@@ ther away .
I will also learn in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest situated observ@@ atory of Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there has been something similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ age - the planet route at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting at Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an extra @-@ terrestrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to which is degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale from one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , measuring 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko will meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion who went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko faces his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight @-@ weigh@@ ted &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to make a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans were looking for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the triple @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ sions to T@@ ire Plat@@ ter
four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping after 2 : 2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well , since there were not the two ad@@ versaries at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was too much for two ad@@ versaries , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a collision don &apos;t want to catch the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be the case that no one besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) is on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better with the three @-@ chain preparation than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are going to operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Radi@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three chain at the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of a failed start after a draw , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the tro@@ phy , we will surely be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start into the season after six or eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped early due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior Minister of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while guests from the Rhin@@ eland leave the Rhin@@ eland as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we have the right to come among the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you must hit in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Evaluation Review published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ Medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started performing tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , migration boards have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the middle of March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics from previous months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the evaluation of biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usually going through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say that we should not do it as if we could it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being able to judge a child as an adult is minimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , manager at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time at all three refur@@ bish@@ ment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , crosses the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete that is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to guarantee stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as operating road .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to get lost .
the special feature is that these are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ cent@@ ering feeling has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting wheat in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , lef@@ ti@@ sts ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites for a big election campaign in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally , the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned at the fountain square , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the leading organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he took care of such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the event at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what it does : at around 20 o &apos;clock , a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz offers various speakers in the Stad@@ thalle , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can reti@@ re - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; hits a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
that &apos;s how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classics , jazz and free play blend into an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Abbey Church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; .
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt very bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette performer faces the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was very much in love with anyone I &apos;ve been using . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially she suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but during school time when she dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself in front of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation burst forth in joy .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather stop us than work on it to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last refusal of a party to find a positive , engaging message from top to bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC chair Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian sorry for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been caught in competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the fact that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which will begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must fulfill some of the criteria for rein@@ statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mour@@ ning act for soldiers in Mali
at a funeral service in the north Hes@@ sian f@@ ritz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister for Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the still un@@ resolved crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two revers@@ ed drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; benef@@ actors of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice they have brought in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen arrived on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er cathedral St. Peter .
at noon only the members of the church took leave .
after that the funeral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among these were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Federal Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trau@@ erg@@ a@@ este laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were standing arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ ail@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defense of the yen called the in@@ filtr@@ ated soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and in@@ filtr@@ ated .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the air@@ crafts of the Tiger @-@ helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilot of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach , commander of the regi@@ ment belonging to the soldiers , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew couldn &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show ministers of the yen : the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that was what the Royal House announced on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried at the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the &apos;s accession to the throne in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 , he retired and also included the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , said L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were constantly flying , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign at the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in Germany had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two faults ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister President Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sachsen , Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the resolution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens Party from its Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ westen , former Green Party member , founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ narr@@ ator wants his faction to record it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is regularly scheduled for 14th January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ ler said that the red @-@ green country government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag quickly resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the State Parliament withdraw@@ s trust and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be judi@@ ci@@ ously checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ yr@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in silence , one will discuss all the questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ äl@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something strange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;

she described herself as a follow@@ er of Black @-@ Green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called on the back@@ sli@@ dden delegates for the return of their Land@@ tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we assume that they return their country report , which they have received through the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group leader Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party Members in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her latest vanity and in her fru@@ stration expressed her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony takes this dirty in@@ tra @-@ game and tries to strike out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ narr@@ ator wants to recommend his MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the SPD group leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of distor@@ ting the results of the Parliament election in 2013 with personal car@@ eers .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD and the SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gi@@ ants , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses on contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , health haz@@ ards are practically impossible .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dis@@ may .
all information and risk assessments are available for consumers .
retailers have the same responsibility as producers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual liquid is exceeded by 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the production operations do not make any immediate blame .
rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices by service providers .
as always there is too little control in case of seri@@ ousness .
is it lacking only at the staff or also on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be found are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made it clear to me several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mixing in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to produce only safe and market@@ able food .
if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumer and consumer are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
the pan@@ try means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supplying animals is not acceptable and must be immediately termin@@ ated .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be clari@@ fied quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Fis@@ cal Reg@@ ulations of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G must prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can safely make the money loose , signing him to N@@ ey@@ mar and bringing him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from focusing on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of € 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen in favor of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are off excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue for the next five years can be accounted for at € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs to try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar via payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will be ambassador to the World Cup and that such manoeu@@ v@@ res for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easily identified .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to comply with any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke of the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey purchases .
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership to PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the fair play because one can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new lap supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ col@@ ate has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , on request of the news agency , confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will complete a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ cks up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing on the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ emaker manufacturer .
as many applicants have in the new call for ten@@ ders , the Swiss does not want to disclose .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss have been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights since 2006 .
before completing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spo@@ ilt with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - nevertheless , they managed to regain the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sh@@ akes the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character runs through an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things dating back to 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another mad evil P@@ lot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good idea of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ side mou@@ sta@@ che of sing@@ les , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang of the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of another type of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; Americans , &quot; directed at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ east@@ erly @-@ west@@ w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director is to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tart@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV just as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was reduced to a smaller length , could better supply its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can do everything for food for a gel@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
a blow to the drug Ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , the officials granted larger quantities of mar@@ ihu@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Ma@@ fia are accused of organized drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has determined its stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Det@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the Grand deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigation was to bring Italian nation@@ als with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank &apos;s account .
wise lam@@ ent large gaps in the foreign registry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions about asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the ali@@ ens &apos; Central Registry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned us in an analysis that is present in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , it is estimated that ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including around 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore administered by some 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data have not been adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in isolated cases data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can significantly slow back processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , moreover , EU citizens are gathered , who do not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assur@@ ances led to a distorted debate about dealing with exc@@ uses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have entered the country .
this is the result of an internal paper published by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
in paper it is said that BA@@ MF carries out such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the paper refers to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can return it to the en@@ rol@@ ment country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU countries would also send back refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing parliament in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system for un@@ lawful admission conditions and a threat to the child &apos;s welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
ahead of all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now distributed 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community hon@@ ors the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the district director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for the cann@@ ed foods are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry to the multiple donated and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many booked Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation on an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthening pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members increasing in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but she sign@@ alled that in the coming years , interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of credit might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus that was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates she repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling down of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forec@@ asted growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forec@@ asted in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a rate increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth in the third quarter is expected to reach 0.3 % despite the fact that the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and minor reduction in salary , as the intensi@@ fication becomes even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income from income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote caused by the sin@@ king of the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ repres@@ sed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the transgres@@ sion in proportion to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS UK announced that pre @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now provided by the health service via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK head Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to make the registration of people possible , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
prevention pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious areas .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as used on a large scale , and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine is procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection can end .
this experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will help to make a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add closet space and mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is rather complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance offer mirr@@ ored units space for all seating and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space allows the beauty of the living room to close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that when you push the door , it is very easy to track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself through good design and increased square meter numbers from something standard to something completely amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate about one of the largest real estate imperial Victoria worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars , and since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as the main operator and the domin@@ ating personality , &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a judicial record states that this means Col@@ in &apos;s property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of $ 176 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ators , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - what Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian legacy states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated Mil@@ ky bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ans shop .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to transmit their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars upon leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and pull our family name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s White House which he wanted to fix : poor information falling into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagnos@@ tic makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame the pump by monitoring its media own .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Candi@@ date Tr@@ ump was angry due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit of control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know of others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets could not have included any more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his co @-@ workers managed to keep away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent the ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , are trying again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors to give the president dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump function@@ aries say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press releases , especially those with embarrass@@ ing le@@ aks , and that he can figure out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what happened at the end of February , when somebody mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ voc@@ ateur , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief sh@@ ale of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations and rev@@ oked them .
Tr@@ ump sums up the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys missions very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the people will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe are sending post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
as the addresses of the sought after heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population are hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting places hide at holiday destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for searching criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been a website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ lana , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online hym@@ ns could not be taken so far , at least eleven of them based on information after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road called Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were ki@@ cked out only in May , without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull that said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be named said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the brook brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible .
to support our collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
made of Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Birken@@ hof .
the house is being renovated at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming into the district , the hotel building offered the District Office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , building sh@@ utt@@ les have been in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors have been pulled out , blankets are partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated downtown level , sh@@ aver emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its roughly 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains sh@@ a@@ vers further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s no@@ tions are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external systems are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public .

Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks the committee recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper became a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there are already first lectures of the body in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interven@@ ing in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigation is to stand up for several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a close look at more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally put in the centre and investigate whether the President may have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether it should be charged .
Grand J@@ uries are therefore also called anchor chambers .
mostly they are turned on when they are larger and controversial .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite people to be inter@@ ro@@ gated under oath .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also involved in the conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the suspension would show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if needed , he wanted to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats a possibility to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this work usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I leader James Com@@ ey said three times that I am not going to be determined against the President .
you have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this accus@@ ation , accus@@ ations against dump@@ ing had become lou@@ dly , he tried to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure on account of the investigation .
after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and his employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later res@@ ig@@ ned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pressures of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented bill charges on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ er could no longer be released so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has become detached from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over one tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now dri@@ fts to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms at the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking was disturbed some years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete meal plan there .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is in danger , because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be dis@@ assembled if a piece breaks down at a key point .
melting of the ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg doesn &apos;t increase the sea level as they float on the water and have pushed ice so much water as it results after the melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest shelf of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow again or come back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not return the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , in recent decades , many ice @-@ sh@@ elling farms in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long top of the Antar@@ c@@ tica lies in the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic survey has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees during the last 50 years , counting it to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the circle @-@ day has penet@@ rated 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be sold this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are 50 vac@@ an@@ cies in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the challenges of the applicant &apos;s scar@@ city in the forward @-@ looking manner .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself in@@ ward and out@@ wards , show concrete measures for cross @-@ country clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age factors from the service .
so it is time to act so that no more positions remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , Group Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .
he had already taken care of a la@@ zy surprise in the circle of the circle , when he questioned the st@@ aff@@ ing expenses public and the other parties were ast@@ o@@ unded .
people want all possibilities to be checked which allow an exit from the municipal employers &quot; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a ho@@ ur@@ ly tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually sees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is available only if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees would take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that deplo@@ y lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean warned that they must not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew effectively co@@ operated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement to the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all alleg@@ ations currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had been monitoring the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boat , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is presum@@ ed that its crew take on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants supplied directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of being over@@ ruled by the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer on board who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel prize winner organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
meanwhile , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine ham@@ mer@@ ers bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome addition .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream layers .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ c@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the view point was at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angles and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - both sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgrades for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being swe@@ at@@ y by wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine , who are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several clubs are still climbing on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the former trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal particularly with the 14 to 30 year olds , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than only once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft to Asia .
what is it all about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or football simulation , will focus on FIFA on a competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program in the 2022 World Cup .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows lots of biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sports - for example elevated heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in the e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million euros .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the football Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
internationally , many countries are already on the move .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was taught as a teaching subject , &quot; she says .
according to D@@ utt , the football league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany lag@@ ged behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
only to decay in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient today .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t cling to the fact that everything remains as it was always with football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy condem@@ ns suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for a negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , folded hands and facing down eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer stated that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they totally depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day on which I do not regret the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get up , spring from a building , get up for yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy asked and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley : learning about the new FC Bayern Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup as captain in the Audi Cup is no accident .
FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm there .

those who have been chosen to take the inheritance of L@@ ah@@ m can use a small extra motivation only well .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flour@@ ished as a mini @-@ l@@ ame on the field .
to the right rear , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ ber@@ ley was at all working in this initial formation as the one who can take the helm well into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( collap@@ sed hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches so he decided to get out of the performance of the Asia journey ( folded also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot not to fall neg@@ atively .
this was quite good at all .
Sü@@ le was running around Kim@@ ber@@ ley , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acting sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and also in the construction of the game , Sü@@ der tried a few times successfully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw afterwards the game .
for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to a few sh@@ ak@@ y statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .
Al@@ aba Mo@@ tiv@@ ates O@@ F@@ B Women
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our e@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller shortly before the game was reported via Twitter and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavarian Legi@@ on@@ aire is a club colleague of Ö@@ F@@ B Captain Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck and is fe@@ ather@@ ing with our ladies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football champion of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
it often tended to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) as well as Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; Wis@@ sing raises the wishes of the economy , which has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the largest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the closing of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the upper priority list of the country .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be right .
a role in the plans of the country is also the west circum@@ vention of Trier , which is in urgent need of the Federal Traffic W@@ ays .
the goal is to put the line into operation in December 2020 , &quot; says Ministeri@@ al spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for regional , but internationally competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is looking for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , the Chamber of Industry and Commerce commen@@ ces .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is to quickly create facts , but at the same time the country is out of the necessary personnel , &quot; says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
until now , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state business of mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce ur@@ ges to award more jobs to external offices .
the CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations made by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the far @-@ so@@ ber@@ ing broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about increased internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister for Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she cleared the field again because of in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said that the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and so it moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to prohi@@ bit or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is also accused of har@@ ass the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s mistakes , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but re@@ trac@@ ted under normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen after acc@@ using Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen . the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft trip through Munich takes place on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you get to the Is@@ ar again on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large information carrier .
it shows a garbage mount .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protected wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los no@@ d@@ les and laughter against sorrow
Mor@@ di@@ llo , at times , was one of the most published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the no@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
the Argent@@ inian also records with 85 and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he worked as a painter for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to a close at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours every day .
with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ pl@@ ets still find much spread worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand foot@@ ball@@ ers as an opponent .
his figures speak for the first time in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought and due to diseases borne insects decreased , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed , because in recent years the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change , which in the spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has implications for the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 years of existence .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the Week@@ ly Fe@@ odo@@ ce employees usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and perpet@@ ual drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and feelings of abdominal pain suff@@ ice .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of being on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while cor@@ p@@ ses are growing throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ amas .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists opened only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , journalists are rarely tried by journalists .
at Fe@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are ru@@ th@@ less and although the terrain is now more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we di@@ stru@@ e all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country since rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gan@@ gli@@ ons bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own safety after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper publishing the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ants problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising began .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it hin@@ dered .
he voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you as a journalist falls to you - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many mur@@ der@@ ers ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could flu@@ ff like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar across from the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love to the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how they can do their work best while remaining alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells false , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing with J@@ avier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space in which the staff of Fe@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half a joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Fe@@ odo@@ ce was li@@ cking on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former famous speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor to carry out a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the entire century all the political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have looked at Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body style . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become ph@@ one@@ tically in the whole country by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and attempts to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
since then she has asked her to be sub@@ divided again by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials involved and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
several branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who in 2015 was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who go back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking sc@@ ares him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Fe@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all of their phones began to h@@ um .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the b@@ unker &apos;s edge , they have published news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think of closing it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ ans living in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of place and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only tw@@ inkle in your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature can be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs in history - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , even though it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a mat@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the amazing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of d@@ and@@ ru@@ ff and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this cam@@ ou@@ ter@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors of the chal@@ k time must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost as much today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived for millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ st@@ ste still cover b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is lying on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the sheds on its sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , at 17.00 hrs there were between the connecting offices Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other .
at first , no information is available about the exact number of injured parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of mild to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large amount of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres long rear @-@ traffic was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also a massive disability on the counter @-@ track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle operators , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing susp@@ end is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uncomfortable or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the wireless card control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ dates the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many other long distances in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
it also has to be purchased through the App of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant is in place at the ticket control at place Y , he knows that a passenger sits there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you like to travel without a ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply check yourself in the DB Navigator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Chief Marketing Officer of Deutsche Bahn AG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest offen@@ ders .
because often one has , in any case , one of the co @-@ trav@@ eller does not have all the documents needed for the evaluation of online tickets .
either the credit card or ID card is missing or any document you have to assign .
the result is endless discussion between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , resulting in poor tuning in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the conductor to take care of other concerns at the end .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
other train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat in St. Louis that she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the streets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ d@@ ded on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her mobile phone off to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and by a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video she said , another polic@@ eman secured his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance , which is made up of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; on the black experience and the black state inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember when I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised therein .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would do a bad job to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were connected with a local business owner who had lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community prof@@ iting from their pain and resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death row in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s experience - to show that the Movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ el &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these junc@@ tions as a black , gay woman stands so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the communications cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she still cl@@ ings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers are discussing bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time yet .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Kamp@@ sten ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ atik ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , as well as the remaining stores benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct sellers offer their products .
the construction work will end with the start of the construction work .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been buying almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ladies always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ chers shop for us .
we would like that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery sett@@ les , comes to the level of rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping m@@ alls in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are rented out only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
it is a pity that specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market stand out during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes up some@@ time .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery already before distributing all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - useless building projects in Bit@@ burg make no place for a farmer &apos;s market hall .
once the farm market is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which resem@@ ble almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st banned 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence after making public @-@ classified diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dis@@ co@@ ed , whose sentence was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp one , although some intellectual commentary not only leads to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits un@@ well on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just returned from the big success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot;
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became an un@@ equal focal point , which changed several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o that fores@@ aw a future in which the president would change the judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump is launching a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after a strange timing , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement , written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic dis@@ member@@ ment , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand foot@@ ball@@ ers of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; hopefully our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing , how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ free phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they cob@@ alt your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which clas@@ h like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
a nationwide human hunting is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as reported by the acts of the Cook County Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27th .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still dead at the scene and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them had now been assessed and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker of the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any imagin@@ able manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to challenge the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them are reinforced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the road@@ map criteria R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map for compliance with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ insertion of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list notes that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigations approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ko &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
speaking with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave rise to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one pre@@ tends to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
that divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could further be assumed by no adverse health impair@@ ment , it was said in the communication .
from now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ L@@ utter .
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency for its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up at your staff , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if anonym@@ ity promised , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer specialist groups and demo@@ graphical groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and direct themselves to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and poll@@ s from specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most discomfort and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they have to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments &apos; fin@@ anz@@ tech web site .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently , u@@ ber signed up as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send customized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has spent Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company supports Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or unfair practic@@ - .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Staff Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry being online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding from companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement after the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees for your feedback , there may be an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask about 4,000 comments , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rette .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
for Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights about the employees , and hopes that in the long run this leads to better engagement of employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you too lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour practice before returning to the Aqu@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday for Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and she has actually extended her days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood carried out practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their start to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ed@@ on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked down with foot balls , which will have a protective net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people hire a room there and then choose to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on the parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit detection by third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fac@@ tual verification that may indicate results of the fact inspection from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to get rid of hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts check was started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Main@@ land River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ ous Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says ten@@ derly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found emo@@ tionally un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I rated my welcome greeting a little &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape sp@@ ears , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust had its full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go all of it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &quot; The Pri@@ est , &quot; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter who hidden the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed in the 18th century who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed quite cro@@ o@@ ks , always paying off debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise arous@@ al . &quot;
after the end of his placement in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes on her website which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Honne@@ f &apos;s citizens , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , that is to say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other communities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f has an average five @-@ digit amount , which will cost your new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in former times , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliber@@ ations .
this meant the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force , and the Navy were dis@@ missed .
since the coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons , who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt , will be negotiating in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the aboli@@ tion of the ban on the ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the great suit with the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan issued another 7@@ 3@@ 95 public servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier .
three times , they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform targets of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically aiming for an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an especially not @-@ called officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens are issued out of other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the present system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for circuit shuttle
over and over again over the past few months over the future of the racing shuttle had been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the em@@ itting route on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the Shuttle Table in the long term according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin on the track this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and renov@@ ate the track Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly committed to this important connection , &quot; stated Minister of Transport , Klaus Pun@@ l , on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the circuit were estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country , will be finally agreed , explained expi@@ atory .
the ministry and the southern Thur@@ in@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , vehicles used and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Shuttle @-@ Shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it was tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route was used by sufficient number of people in order to regularly order them in the future .
the track is also very cold in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should concern ourselves
just as you thought it can &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots will come .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if one goes one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , trouble one of the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their growing popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ ro@@ me eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the Spe@@ ech of 2017 : maid
does Tr@@ um@@ ps provide great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ heart@@ edness of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized U.S. voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ selecting relatives .
we are all trying hard to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and occupied himself with the Republi@@ cans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everybody who knows her , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the Left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the ign@@ iting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer meet us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s Urugu@@ ay@@ an version of the mad - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the cli@@ mati@@ sing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &quot; s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to settle the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need .
the poor woman in the department store stood without excuse , while I was tired of the experience to spread my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he suffered by the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say they were too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarter @-@ students from F@@ emen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three students go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grows up in the chi@@ ckens &quot; yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the cheerful sound brought a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eagle in the chi@@ ckens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
peasant Arnold found a strange egg and left it f@@ rat@@ er@@ nis@@ ed by his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who carried the cylinders to the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school leader An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every fourth @-@ class vessel that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps into class passes , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the ch@@ ick period is over , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she dis@@ missed lessons very reluc@@ t@@ antly because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door wat@@ chers .
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ class students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , refer@@ enced by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of people illeg@@ ally camped in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place significant fin@@ es on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls will be carried out throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should improve the emission characteristics of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Kraft@@ fahrt Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler had told us to write to everyone involved .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be settled in its framework .
how long should the retro@@ fitting be drawn ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily in the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat to a massive decline in Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
so far there is no loss of value for older diesel in the rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .

Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ cher Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re in the coming year .
the place is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work still gives him a lot of fun as he conve@@ ys in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - there should be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach works as a legal entity for the administrative community , the applicant has to present relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill them out more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and to itself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good operating climate as well as good mood among authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking space approximately have been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium refur@@ bish@@ ment is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will deal with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
there is a lot of le@@ e@@ way for a city @-@ builder .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexibly on many occasions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the creation of green spaces is often mentioned with praise by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city engineer emphasizes .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high level of responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of co @-@ operation : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to be buried in Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed academic or Bachelor &apos;s degree course with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt der Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) is hosting civil engineering , urban planning , renovation matters , administration of urban property , urban farm with building yard and urban landsc@@ aping , as well as the underground construction law office including heritage protection .
bicycle thrown on lines : South track locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle off the railway track crossing in the Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and have been searching for them since the night @-@ hours .
in close proximity to the crime scene , witnesses have been observing a rac@@ er sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the borders of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for the rail transport traffic , there could also be sponsors of the railway customers to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway track could be led without hin@@ dran@@ ce .
almost ten passenger trains had been on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says just the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes ga@@ stri@@ c cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the University of Washington discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han tolerated a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lieu , when the same system also works in humans .
post@@ doctoral student , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , investigated a kind of immune cell that fo@@ sters tolerance than it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but had not had it separately .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they obtained the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked out on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira flo@@ cked at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ provision @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which admitted M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho yet wanted three other new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in Heaven
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ demo@@ cra@@ t prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
merely no fire @-@ fire from the party headquarters , merely a head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , thus lu@@ red the most important wish of the election champi@@ ons .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the workers from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with increasing horror watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would be described with head@@ wind not even in the approach .
there were deep stops .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise group outlet of a Green Party member has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the ex @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and El@@ ection Officer of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion si@@ ghs when the new job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there for the CD@@ U , after the passing of the green de@@ pu@@ ties , to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery started with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , was cal@@ med by the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD in its sleeves , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf bank@@ rupt@@ cy nour@@ ished the party smoothly .
the comrades lab@@ ori@@ ously rose again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next depression .
mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD chief of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made everything wrong , which can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time because of the VW @-@ gas @-@ revolution@@ aries and its role in the supervisory board .
mi@@ ological survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they talked about Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz not at all .
at times the comrades make every effort to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mr@@ s T@@ westen puts their own career decisions on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate for her individual , but on the national list of the lower Sax@@ on Green Party , the lower Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago the voters agreed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ sächs@@ ische SPD as the leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U MPs will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local people III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can get support from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been rehabilitation areas in sensitive areas .
back then , in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to also promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the sum of the subsi@@ dy amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euro would come from the country , the rest from the community .
how does a san@@ itation area come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one becomes , as Sch@@ in@@ dler further , to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role in which there is no interest whatsoever in the planned area .
if necessary , the territorial borders could then also shift again .
the bar represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal state programme in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be established as a statute .
since 1 January 2017 , the funding period for the funding continues until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock intake would be conducted only once , in the framework of those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December the pro@@ posi@@ tional decision should take place as far as possible so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned pre @-@ examinations .
it is a matter of ass@@ essing the urban ab@@ uses and deciding when it is being rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back again and get a picture of the situation , promising them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property B@@ ow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which deals among other things about the structural condition and refur@@ bish@@ ment views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on the size , layout and inhabitants of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled in when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - whoever comes first , first warns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later periods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; town center II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or puts himself a micro@@ chip in order to come home and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through their company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisor an@@ aes@@ thesi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the pay@@ ers of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers .
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military supplies donated to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicop@@ ters made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut were exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine yacht , a fire truck from Wisconsin and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forklift truck .
the White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Nav@@ al Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with great visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message indicates that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
the records provided by the TI@@ ME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a push for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but asking their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the Pres@@ idential plane was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the President &apos;s plane by his predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thri@@ lled by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington region and the South La@@ wn area in order to susp@@ end US President at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ idential Assistance Committ@@ ees . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky speaker said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estim@@ ation rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether he inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky job
the championship leader of the second tennis league soccer league goes to the third place in Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC @-@ blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite after five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga was given the sense of the reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at least has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
imports from the high North provide class and stability in the S@@ V subur@@ ban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to inserts in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is currently active in the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent of the Italian Bi@@ ella is not part of the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Spiele , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liber@@ ec competition will be part of his first action during this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
he should also be present in Kiel , as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the coach station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay re@@ fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress had put in a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against U.S. assault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from the O@@ MV , together with other European companies , have been wor@@ rying about the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership Nord Stream 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threat of dr@@ one is enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even had to raise the sanctions by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the center of attention in the series of net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars kill@@ ers reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ id@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch @-@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day care centers the clock is turned back .
on 1 September , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nur@@ sery facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked meals .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
in the past kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are taken care of 45 days of the week are eating in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees will have kitchen service from 1 September . they warm up the food delivered , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , give the food , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by a special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen &apos;s performance , also has the charm that it has exhibited in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign award for the city as the most economical one , it says from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in the area of education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the Provin@@ cial Council elections . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate un@@ condi@@ tionally and be involved in all parts of the election process .
the parliamentary elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international fighting action to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at about 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to talk to the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the petition but went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpet@@ rators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .
without prey the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow , with managers from the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments in the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits alongside other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ et &apos;s insist@@ ed that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being promoted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we value continuous commitment with employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we realise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operational processes change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record fall ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season .
upon completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans state is that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to subscribe to one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players by themselves , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter kno@@ cked down and damaged
during the night of Friday on Saturday an unknown killer has intentionally over@@ thrown a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damage of over 200 Euros .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for advice .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car met him on his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to avoid and tou@@ red the console .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was travelling with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on Thursday evening .
in the area of the circum@@ vention of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his lane so that he had to do@@ dge to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console .
damage to the car caused damage to cars .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it can be good that the driver did not notice the accident at all .
the police are now asking for the incident as well as the driver of the cause @-@ causing vehicle to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on Tel 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , Spo@@ k@@ es@@ person of the Reform Movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; according to the publication of the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would very well serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false estim@@ ation of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence among the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , there were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the raid in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it was about &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and it &apos;s a dev@@ our@@ ing fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a quite normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely un@@ ju@@ stly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the reminder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ zek@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was appointed by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of aggression between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also more violent .
in contrast to numerous other accused , however , many cas@@ u@@ alties inv@@ ali@@ date the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in numerous cases , even in spite of violence , even bring positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , E@@ zek@@ ne explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of abuse of violence against protective cases in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ er@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you assess this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
he has just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or involvement in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside its sphere of influence .
it is possible to throw at it at best not to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to sp@@ ittle frac@@ tures .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just kne@@ ad with chairs and put the key@@ chain on the floor , but also distributed ear cow@@ ards and pulled too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he has admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are tri@@ vial .
one wonders if it is not about his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just collap@@ sed on him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still busy .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report , the media reports a great deal about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be charged with regard to sexual abuse in the final report as well ?
Michael H@@ emann : definitely no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults is claiming to have entrusted the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even commit themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director who would have been a colleague of the cul@@ pr@@ its professionally .
how is R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael H@@ emann : a question@@ able student expressed it like this : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben are more urgent or clear or even more likely to have opened than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that students and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any involvement .
neither can he be accused of preventing him or bringing him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forci@@ ble eating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge che@@ ek out of sexual abuse and abuse of violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
the report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and portra@@ yed and , among them terri@@ bly suffering , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
on this , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; primary school &quot; was tab@@ oo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael H@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims rated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have been om@@ itted .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish himself and of the events at a school on which he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut his ears before the states ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , who even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison sentence will continue to be practi@@ sed in the primary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended penetration .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test@@ ers were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows still .
it was hard to estimate for him , where the affected people might exagger@@ ate or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been crossed .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the prison sentence was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falling down of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the danger of ass@@ essing the past after today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already been quite right .
this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so to sla@@ p the ears and the hair@@ s and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the topic of testing also contribute to language ?
Michael H@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , from his perspective , because the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not mean that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y on your own , you won &apos;t be a big singer or a big singer , right in the field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do something to a fly .
I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ ears are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up today and which they almost worship .
and please , once again , clearly : all that you are accused of are educational methods that were on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intention behind it is all too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves the burden on him .
now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had earned great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
