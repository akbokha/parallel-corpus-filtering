<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former basis of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows this, who had to get upset, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarian State Government, are anything but current - yet very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickenteppI, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called judgments, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops retreated with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, they were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and therewith the Bavarian survey of surveying." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The data sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was 21 years after drawing up the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 alongside today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered pieces from the so-called "original" from which the Basic Tax has been derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots claim there today no more farmers - but small gardeners of the facility "Land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based Irish institute" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was born there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the ankle of the so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, first place was place, later was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesianism meet at the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural terms of the original building of the Irrencement factory, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was marked as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allied bombings broke many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a chapel dating back to the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn regular route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman Group publishes TravelWarning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur throughout the state and are noted here," "" "stated in the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination, as well as the state enforcement authorities that disproportionately target minorities, led the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be halted or killed because of their skin colour, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri State Office in which black motorists in the state will be halted 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be prepared to bring in chewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime series of the FBI, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further racial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidebaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU place association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the slewing court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows, as Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales come to the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also chairman of BLHV, he described the fence project as" "" "elementary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much has to be dealt with with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not lead to organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy with the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reafforestation of the areas could be dragged off for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area covers 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture-magic.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and housewives, it doesn't work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiss also stated: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Science Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state grant of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveying backdrop referred to by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be protected should not be strippery (slope climbing above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishermenbacher Weird-Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of ship owners and Liberty-Imiteers would have lyched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on the meaning, and in particular the importance that was attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller called Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is genuinely correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It concerns the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "thy weary, thy poor, and thy oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of thy abundant coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: the mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus altered the meaning of the statue, the right-wing people wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservative who brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh came across quite unusually here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, eleventful but hopeful people after long and often dreadful journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as a team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "their captain's speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that made Eilidh quite natural were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-section runner Muir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman looking for a great season which included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Captain of the team says that they are "immensely proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a big honor anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and elected me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics over Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers smashed it because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's Staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to bust his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side is unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous by employees who are designated as officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hasserted people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I was polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news release" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what employees of the Governor referred to as a" "" "concentrated spamming attack" "" "would probably be called" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cloths and to arrest and arrest demonstrators." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question happened last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable account had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters boosted his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines that are never tested in practice without any major interruption with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government agencies than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline which expired on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of Ozone in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" "" "interfering in local decisions or impede economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump Attorney of Oklahoma, for a long time was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or delaying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Pruit regulatory roll back agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under earlier administrations, EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for execution and then been waiting to be accused of activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and authority that gives us serious." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="454">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure has not yet been set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of the States who sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressures.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "the reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," "" "said Schneiderman."

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the 6th Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful location.</seg>
<seg id="469">The preservation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of Tumarc a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it's a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer UrCustombuch. Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tumlingen including the Vogur "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the deed, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a marvellous court which belonged to the church or the right of patronage and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" is the third, the most beautiful settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church right.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman, who built a church and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church bases, and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were to be collapsed in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilary was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the spring of 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-dwarf still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"" "today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the" "" "Schaffhausen retirees" "" "as successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius installation." ""</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumarc invite you to the 6th Serenade on Sunday, July 16th, at the old cemetery of St. Hilary chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest," "" "said the organizers the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance to tumours and hearing-diggers.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumarc feel particularly committed to home care, such as Serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.</seg>

<seg id="506">"" "the" "" "Boisheim weaves" "" "association called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there existed only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "asparagus" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Only a few days before, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power station zone in the Boisheimer Nette due to a change in the land use plan - but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a lack of form.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted authorisation process remains unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim "" "." "" "</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes it to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of some 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one-fifth of the electricity requirement of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a shareholding in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="533">The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to entice the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers about what offers their own city has in store away from the usual supermarket goods.</seg>
<seg id="535">Therefore, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.</seg>

<seg id="543">Attractive offers for Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or reopened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals lost sight of the city centre while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to liven the inner city - up to landlords, the factories of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which was partly wide-spread, had told King in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian towns participate in the third "home shopping" day.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max amount works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work in their voluntary year at several places.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where to go anywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in stone in the furniture exchange, once a week I am working here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, wide range I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I made a high school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer study, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is a falsehood for me and I want to do something different with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, as there is an insight, you can see how it is on site, at the focal point maybe, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I have collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social sector during the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably in Jugendamt Herne, I'm going to have a social worker education and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.</seg>

<seg id="702">It always depends where you are doing his FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">One can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme is started to overcome the pressure the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job reduction, announced by the General Director John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">In May, Pearson announced a third cost reduction plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="723">Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed at suicide attack</seg>
<seg id="724">A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.</seg>
<seg id="725">Five soldiers and one interpreter have been violated, announced a NATO Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="726">According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qaragh district.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a NATO statement, it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, suicide bombings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had executed this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On 31 May, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most lethal militant attack in the country since the US-led troops crushed the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan because US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies and in particular the call of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two counterparts, the Council of Faulorn decides to set up a common space in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">Although it may take a while until the area is owned by the church community, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">For this there is a discussion about a common space.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Municipal Council levitates such a common area not to be seen as a meeting place just for the residents of the seniorical housing, but openly in the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "as an example, the word" "" "StrickCafé" "" "made the round." ""</seg>
<seg id="756">"" "" "" "the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget will be missed by funding opportunities." ""</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is located in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">The establishment of a common space would be so reported by Tjades, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this regard there is no billet between the legs, the determination that both saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding environment - as well as an optional pitched roof - which would reduce the pitch and make the construction more economical - possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer means this addition.</seg>
<seg id="761">If it helps: it is unanimous that it passes the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not that easy with the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "Daniela's call refers to the many of his own buildings, with which one does not move so well, but now you lean back to the common room from the window, she says," "" "I'm having a hard time with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a hidden subsidy on wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsidy, but I get a real countervalue that is marketable in case of doubt, the opposite is.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigers's request to propose the proposed resolutions accordingly finds three proponents.</seg>
<seg id="768">So it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan Haller summarizes: "when we hold the decision, we make a giant leap forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (RättsMedicinalverket) started performing tests last year.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is complied with.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete that is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to guarantee stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastener, which is also used as operating road.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to get lost.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special feature is that these are finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger Company Dizwo.</seg>

<seg id="923">Particular finger-centering feeling has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>

<seg id="933">The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, leftists) belong to a broad alliance that shows peacefully this day, because the AfD invites for a big election campaign in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle in Rondell.</seg>

<seg id="943">Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he took care of such an event and got the supplement.</seg>

<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy President Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also a short time after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Fiscal Regulations of Football on Neymars Move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG must prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can safely make the money loose, signing him to Neymar and bringing him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And even though Platini has fallen in favor of the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare off excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue for the next five years can be accounted for at €44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs to try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar will be ambassador to the World Cup and that such manoeuvres for UEFA regulators could be easily identified.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to comply with any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke of the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated sales of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership to PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1190">At one point, a character runs through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things dating back to 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another mad evil Plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good idea of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's underside moustache of singles, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang of the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is reminiscent of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "Americans," directed at the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-easterly-westwrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director is to be a found TV show: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tartum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV just as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "", "which was reduced to a smaller length, could better supply its Agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." ""</seg>

<seg id="1213">At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77, and arrest warrants were issued against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials granted larger quantities of marihuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add closet space and mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steelwork is rather complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer mirrored units space for all seating and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">The perception of a glamorous space allows the beauty of the living room to close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is so important that when you push the door, it is very easy to track." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a vestigial form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can transform itself through good design and increased square meter numbers from something standard to something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a debate about one of the largest real estate imperial Victoria worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars, and since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul as the main operator and the dominating personality, "described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"" "" "" "a judicial record states that this means Colin's property worth $316 million and Paul has a value of $176 million." ""</seg>

<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed mediators, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - what Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian legacy states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated Milky bars and delicatessen from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transmit their property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House which he wanted to fix: poor information falling into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnostic makes sense, but others have tried to tame the pump by monitoring its media own.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Candidate Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were to be persuaded," "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit of control, according to six ex-election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know of others - that Trumps tweets could not have included any more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers managed to keep away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent the ump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, are trying again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to give the president doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump functionaries say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he can figure out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when somebody maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateur, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief shale of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he voiced false accusations and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump sums up the article and started asking employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys missions very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made up of the former Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house is being renovated at the gates of Freudenstadt and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming into the district, the hotel building offered the District Office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenchib.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building shuttles have been in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when entering the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special issuer Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks the committee recorded the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "calling on people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper became a sign that Mueller extended and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first lectures of the body in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of intervening in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The focus of the investigation is to stand up for several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a close look at more and more Trumps private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump has personally put in the centre and investigate whether the President may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Juries are therefore also called anchor chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when they are larger and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to invite people to be interrogated under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN broadcaster, charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumps counselors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election boss Paul Manafort were also involved in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the suspension would show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if needed, he wanted to act quickly." ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the Democrats a possibility to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this work usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey said three times that I am not going to be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey was fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this accusation, accusations against dumping had become loudly, he tried to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure on account of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress such as the Watergate affair about the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the pressures of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented bill charges on Thursday, after which the special issuer could no longer be released so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims at the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf, the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete meal plan there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be disassembled if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of the ice shelf and iceberg doesn't increase the sea level as they float on the water and have pushed ice so much water as it results after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will continue to grow again or come back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not return the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, many ice-shelling farms in the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long top of the Antarctica lies in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic survey has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees during the last 50 years, counting it to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the circle-day has penetrated 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are apparently very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be sold this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are 50 vacancies in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract the challenges of the applicant's scarcity in the forward-looking manner.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself inward and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-country climbers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a regular competition of the public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who excrete disease or age factors from the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is time to act so that no more positions remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Group Leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had already taken care of a lazy surprise in the circle of the circle, when he questioned the staffing expenses public and the other parties were astounded.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked which allow an exit from the municipal employers "association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a hourly tariff," "" "states peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually sees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is available only if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrants "lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that deploy lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean warned that they must not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone," "" "said the organization in a statement to the social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1587">It is presumed that its crew take on board dinghy migrants supplied directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can shut down so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of being overruled by the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "to their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, Nobel prize winner organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Meanwhile, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine hammerers bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sightseeings for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">View points followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream layers.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely longer ascents for the long tricals.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga upgrades for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being sweaty by wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high garages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first Bundesligavereine, who are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven are qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal particularly with the 14 to 30 year olds, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than only once a year to send the Bundesligamannschaft to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or football simulation, will focus on FIFA on a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves, in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And E-Sports is already part of the official program in the 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobbing dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows lots of biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example elevated heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>

<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardised, because in recent years the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which in the spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a micro bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of it. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The Weekly Feodoce employees usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and perpetual drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and feelings of abdominal pain suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while corpses are growing throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice." two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamas.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists opened only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists are rarely tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Feodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are ruthless and although the terrain is now more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we distrue all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country since rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected ganglions bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for its own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper publishing the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxicants problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising began.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it hindered.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living" "", "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done in the face of so many murderers... why did you not tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could fluff like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love to the routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best while remaining alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," "" "in order to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space in which the staff of Feodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half a joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Feodoce was licking on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor to carry out a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers would have looked at Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "journalists have become phonetically in the whole country by writing in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on walkways and constructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">"" "" "" "on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and attempts to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case." ""</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then she has asked her to be subdivided again by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials involved and a valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of place and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy soil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only twinkle in your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs in history - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, even though it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a mating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of dandruff and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this camouterrier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk time must have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when giant thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Haustste still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she was sitting on the bed of an airbnb flat in St. Louis that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the streets," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retdded on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was there, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone off to return later in the evening to Tweets on people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who wore a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video she said, another policeman secured his rifle and cried, "I'll kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not usual," "" "Ferrell remembered her testimony." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and weeping." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance, which is made up of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell, with her daughter wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had "on the black experience and the black state innumerable times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember when I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised therein.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would do a bad job to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter were connected with a local business owner who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell in the sense:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by innumerable cases of people, often of whites - in a community profiting from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to make it different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for so I shall be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferr's experience - to show that the Movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets" show surprising personal aspects of Ferr's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people there must be a certain vulnerability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrel's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have marked the film "BlackLivesMatter," in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether," Ferrell said, "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatical type of action" "", "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "it was the person who shook up this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman stands so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the communications cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2094">While advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, as well as the remaining stores benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct sellers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will end with the start of the construction work.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are rented out only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It is a pity that specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market stand out during the construction period?</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which resemble almost imperceptibly - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg in cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst banned 35-year-old prison sentence after making public-classified diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering discoed, whose sentence was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, like someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp one, although some intellectual commentary not only leads to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just returned from the big success of her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became an unequal focal point, which changed several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili's Kanungo that foresaw a future in which the president would change the judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is launching a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after a strange timing, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement, written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded an end to the "automatic dismemberment, the basis of gender, race, sexuality, and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand footballers of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"hopefully our genome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands-free phone.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up at your staff, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if anonymity promised, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer specialist groups and demographical groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and direct themselves to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and polls from specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most discomfort and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments' finanztech web site.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Recently, uber signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "as Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized" "" "pulse" "" "surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has spent Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company supports Convercent, problems previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practic-.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Staff Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry being online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement after the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask about 4,000 comments, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have too much relied on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you don't follow employees," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so Errette.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">For Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights about the employees, and hopes that in the long run this leads to better engagement of employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Mainland River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaious Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found emotionally unexpectedly.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had its full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history on a broader base, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>

<seg id="2348">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire drawing of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over and over again over the past few months over the future of the racing shuttle had been contested - now it is supposed to go quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the emitting route on which the tourist train runs.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the Shuttle Table in the long term according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work will begin on the track this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to continue to order and renovate the track Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is particularly committed to this important connection," stated Minister of Transport, Klaus Punl, on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the circuit were estimated at around 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country skips 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country, will be finally agreed, explained expiatory.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should concern ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," enthuses True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one goes one step towards Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, trouble one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "says it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their growing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic pictures, the intricate body and the stochrome eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Does Trumps provide great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-heartedness of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized U.S. voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-selecting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all trying hard to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet, who lives in Chicago and occupied himself with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everybody who knows her, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left has been strengthened by Trump, but the igniting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "trump" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will no longer meet us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing "normalizes" that suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's Uruguayan version of the mad - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the climatising music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">As many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40 "s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to settle the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood without excuse, while I was tired of the experience to spread my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>

<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>

<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan tolerated a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieu, when the same system also works in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Postdoctoral student, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, investigated a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance than it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but had not had it separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they obtained the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked out on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication he made everything wrong, which can be done wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time because of the VW-gas-revolutionaries and its role in the supervisory board.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to rehabilitate his house in the years can get support from the country soon.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development on Wednesday in sensation.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in sensitive areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the area of refurbishment I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the area of refurbishment II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "success project" - it is important to also promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidium of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The sum of the subsidy amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euro would come from the country, the rest from the community.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a sanitation area come about?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "one becomes, as Schindler further, to investigate where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role in which there is no interest whatsoever in the planned area.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial borders could then also shift again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The bar represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the" "" "Social City" "" "federal state programme in which the restructurings would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be established as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">Since 1 January 2017, the funding period for the funding continues until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the stock intake would be conducted only once, in the framework of those involved in the refurbishment area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December the propositional decision should take place as far as possible so that the restructurings can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned pre-examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is a matter of assessing the urban abuses and deciding when it is being rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective property there will also be a remark in the land register.</seg>

<seg id="2697">"" "" "" "Gotzel stressed," "" "a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "Building and Property Bow" "", "which deals among other things about the structural condition and refurbishment views." ""</seg>

<seg id="2702">However, it is important to note that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not conducive to funding.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military supplies donated to the TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopters made in Connecticut were exhibited beside a Maine yacht, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a Mississippi forklift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Naval Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"" "" "" "I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with great visibility," "" "said the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation." ""</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The records provided by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A Sikorsky speaker said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen" report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, Spokesperson of the Reform Movement "We are Church," according to the publication of the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would very well serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false estimation of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence among the Domspatzen, there were" "" "two measures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the raid in Regensburg no one doubted that it was about "shameful and shameful acts," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and it's a devouring fresco." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a quite normal educational means" "", "" "" "to deal with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They were unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely unjustly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the reminder" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Ezekemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was appointed by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of aggression between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility." 67 Domspatzen was sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other accused, however, many casualties invalidate the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in numerous cases, even in spite of violence, even bring positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezekne explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of abuse of violence against protective cases in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as cholercian and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you assess this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or involvement in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also took place outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to throw at it at best not to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The domain gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony, describes it as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to spittle fractures.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just knead with chairs and put the keychain on the floor, but also distributed ear cowards and pulled too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he has admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, they are trivial.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not about his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just collapsed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still busy.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the media reports a great deal about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be charged with regard to sexual abuse in the final report as well?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hemann: definitely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults is claiming to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of the affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even commit themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral director who would have been a colleague of the culprits professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How is Ratzinger's Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: a questionable student expressed it like this: "concerning sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that... Buben are more urgent or clear or even more likely to have opened than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes:" "" "the fact that students and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any involvement.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Neither can he be accused of preventing him or bringing him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "forcible eating" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hatzemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge cheek out of sexual abuse and abuse of violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and portrayed and, among them terribly suffering, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the subject of "primary school" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiacal" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the domain gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims rated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the accusation remains to have been omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just began to establish himself and of the events at a school on which he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "the prison sentence will continue to be practised in the primary school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended penetration.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testers were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows still.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate for him, where the affected people might exaggerate or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the prison sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hemann: we historians talk about the" "" "falling down of anachronism" "", "so the danger of assessing the past after today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">This, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, so to slap the ears and the hairs and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic of testing also contribute to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, because the Domspatzen only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not mean that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy on your own, you won't be a big singer or a big singer, right in the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hatzemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and heartfelt people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do something to a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspears are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up today and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again, clearly: all that you are accused of are educational methods that were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves the burden on him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the lawyer would command a 93-year-old man who had earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
