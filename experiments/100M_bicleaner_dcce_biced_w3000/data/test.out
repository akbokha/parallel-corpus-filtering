28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
to combine his style with his family was to make us cook something , prepare dinner for us , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond which lit up every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone who has information in this case is asked to call the post@@ erior calls of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now made it un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or glued on from outside labels which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a TV with a loose d@@ oom and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they ask the question of the wish for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the Py@@ ramid of Sports
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Py@@ ramid of Sports &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their closing night , they drove home to the for@@ age in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyrami@@ ds .
there is no lack of awards for the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already spotted him .
long is the 18th awar@@ dee of the Py@@ ramid of Sports .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award gives me a great deal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the young talents for decades .
and so he also gave the € 25,000 prize money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competitions include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the founder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the row@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ eh@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um@@ um of the hand@@ cu@@ ffs Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sporting legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are at odds with the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
that on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep things small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively go back to regulations , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost immediately .
the democratic candidate says even the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be party internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , intends to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should then also be paid better , requires about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says that he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather more about the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to stimulate growth .
his critics declared him that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand Clinton stands , who wants at least to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who has escaped has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen are four women sitting .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has her little son laid in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the executive vice @-@ president of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria , and among other things she deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are chicken .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ central quarters for all @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the organisation together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s help .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence in her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death thre@@ aten them or because their families send them to Europe as a hope @-@ bearer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away from it because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is no r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who thinks that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , are ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble , told B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the North of Munich are traumati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation just for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some reply with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing as accommodation for governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , wing@@ ed women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , floors or own houses are available only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations for women only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
as much as the women feel this need of protection , it is possible to read off the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the resident doctors called on their union to appro@@ ve new work combat measures in case of dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called on its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers would have been ab@@ used to deal with the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed to reject a contract that was agreed with by the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems which led to the Treaty being rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board of Directors agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and call for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour combat measures starting at the beginning of September .
the quar@@ rels led to assistance physicians to strike six times this year , the first overall cas@@ u@@ alties in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana came back after the election for the rejection of the agreed Terms of Con@@ tract , which had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians and medical students that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish opposite @-@ player in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is the most willing to reconci@@ le this reconciliation .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be ad@@ orable and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything bad .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s brilliant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the launching of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was sore .
Putin informed and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ construct the cous@@ in becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious were alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are clear .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily interested in all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his office during a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , national TV predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , since it considers his reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state secured a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that feel driven from the West and feel ill treated and now f@@ aded .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria where Moscow recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk to each other at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS should only be reduced to back office roles .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when she had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all the RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized head office and the stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail banking , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue any global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these trademarks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves his 3,@@ 000@@ th profit on Pre@@ dil@@ ection at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 300@@ ,000 British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he put a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot , it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori perc@@ ei@@ ves the jubil@@ ation when he takes the victory on a pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone just a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have inspired fans for many years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 wins if he was not only a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie has already scored nearly 30 years winner in GB , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mount , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , at the beginning , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month barri@@ ster , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his top form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 5 years of age .
Russian Putin Mo@@ ves Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin illeg@@ ally released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it is said that Putin has ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian President without giving reasons for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that later it was the head of the government and the staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in terms of bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces persu@@ ade ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin and worked for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at one time would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - confi@@ dently entr@@ ust it to this post for four years .
how it turns out I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia because a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another well @-@ known ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series follows , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , will probably be published at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS television studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g in Sit@@ com , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ ddle For Fish , which landed in Ban@@ ff Garden
a man of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in Ban@@ ff in his garden .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale could act , which were sp@@ un from a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ on Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slo@@ ping cables .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing a truly epic achievement in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete bath in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the closure is a trend @-@ setting high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tur@@ tle , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the country .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - they were just a few milli@@ metres on each side .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being tos@@ sed off fishing boat off Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming as their boat moved on from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turning around and set the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hung on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the board of the coast and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this was dis@@ b@@ anded when the boat was dischar@@ ged by the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
today , someone watches over these men .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .

she then al@@ armed her sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be taken up much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that in the next few years Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
however , the big point in the town hall is , &quot; Brat@@ mann said : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and yet to be financed , will provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brat@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make as few rules as possible for investors .
the left wants even harder runs for investors .
regardless of this , so Brat@@ mann embark@@ s on a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not quite complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compensate for the loss of other around 1300 affordable housing that will run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planned act@@ ress Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the western city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , one distances oneself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and children no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many over the last decade .
Po@@ k@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons to be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the cock and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person re@@ stores each day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people , who exercise 30 minutes each day , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look el@@ end .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also angry playing cor@@ rup@@ ters who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will dimin@@ ish over time .
due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , more f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in the Dam@@ age
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the line brilliant .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast took off on Thursday for the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team fellow A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; performs on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth , while she reinfor@@ ces her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ lete but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ dd@@ led after winning both gold and silver in the single multi @-@ competition ale of women in the art gymn@@ as@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell party of the reti@@ ring man Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia Arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has won no more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ afa led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Swe@@ des and Bo@@ eh@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and put on top of it with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly when she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears streaming on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , which is called &quot; O@@ MA , &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her practice she over@@ came the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the most le@@ thal attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous attack by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y fall , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting has led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks and two others were injured in h@@ is@@ panic dwelling areas within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ qui@@ ties Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented several signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies suffering from birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards , Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana , told that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua alone would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather reported that there would be an additional 3 to 5 inch of rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while in the mobile area it was still ra@@ ining .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record level over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood waters in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his son &apos;s son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose greatly over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and stre@@ amed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife H@@ ans@@ ford said that in the 48 years she lived there , she never saw such a high level of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the hin@@ dran@@ ces and he would be the only one to swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spreading rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation directives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer appeared near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been considerably balanced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and classes in five school districts .
the WW@@ L &apos;s C@@ BS subsidiary reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both floo@@ ded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven animals washed from the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua were closed almost two dozens of roads due to the high water and sand bags provided for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to be reported floo@@ ded on Thursday , but they were not reported on Friday .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enriched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown experienced several shot wounds , including in the loin , leg , arm , and stomach , but that he was in the hospital during his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot , his small body was en@@ chan@@ ted by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ saw the scene .
it seems that this is clearly a long struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems that there are several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles arrived in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are presently re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ eer on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
it reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ia office in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflecting the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America ju@@ bel@@ ed .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly gy@@ rating routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see trainers all over the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs who can support the business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to offer to the commun@@ es inn@@ um@@ erable young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easier accessible turn @-@ up training .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics institute of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( above all black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors wish to organize further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted for election rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the staff and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians are supposed to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend contributions to improve the care of non @-@ stop times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance physicians , announced last night in a message : &quot; resident doctors have still seriously raised concerns to the proposed contract , especially that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and treat it to treat all physicians . &quot;
at only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes arising from discussions appe@@ aled to the government for re@@ vocation and sometimes sil@@ enced in de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the necessity and address the concerns of the resident physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the resident doctors made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 termin@@ ations , as nur@@ ses and specialists were consul@@ ted to cover doctors on the stri@@ ker chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Con@@ tract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to make a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , urged the resident to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employment measures do not reach little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the assistant doctors &quot; committee and responded positively to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a professional apprenticeship , training ch@@ ests , mutual recognition of cur@@ riculum , continuing education and the Ministry of Health on compliance with the B@@ MA agreement in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is given after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended an intake of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended an intake of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls forming har@@ ms .
if the plaque breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots break , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Healthcare Technologies Training Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a temporary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets electoral fraud thri@@ ve in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , ignor@@ ing a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intoler@@ ances regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set barriers outside of electoral cabinet to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should prove their identity in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er must name only his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report proposes to apply not removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they release their voting voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let electoral sc@@ andal in East London .
last year , a special electoral court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man was said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of an im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be another .
Sir Eric said that throughout the country there is evidence of fraud .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions had ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensi@@ tivities on eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric proposed 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists manipul@@ ate letter selection papers to stop &quot; election re@@ aping . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter of letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists will process full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post@@ war &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for elec@@ tive stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of legislation that facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act in 1983 ( Volks@@ justi@@ fiable Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of Photography in El@@ ection stations .
requirement that only English should be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees rule the rule that voters go alone in the election cab .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on account of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous doubles from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ ver of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing for gold that has its own famous double @-@ worker - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the fighter and the wolf : crew member of the US team in bow @-@ shooting Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the crew member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British White jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big expressive eyes is said to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal event Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian is att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds Analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m outdoors @-@ style swimming @-@ aff@@ el indign@@ ant viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian channel C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; like M@@ ief went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoors style pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought into the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited I went as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sponge the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers in the whole of Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard , with which many were talking about him
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let &apos;s all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry it has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the notice of Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ s comments relate to the performance of the float and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald exc@@ used in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympic program , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the float and not to it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reg@@ ained and left the store without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the under@@ pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , getting dressed and out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther anyone looking at someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the pants which she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how absurd to think that someone would take home under@@ pants who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to pull out the pieces of clothing after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had started her and went out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers nearby .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn around the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you turn back from behind , then you should turn around first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before h@@ itting it with your free el@@ bow .
then strike him with his knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the attack@@ er is bent against pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
put the weight on the gun at the same time and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and the stran@@ gl@@ ehold of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the pres@@ enter and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k turned his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a draw@@ bar of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show up and show us what it is going to be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of det@@ ecting the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw@@ string that has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left behind him , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public funds at railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task definitely put his immune system under a test
in the film he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject after her lumin@@ ometer number was more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s coming close to the worst that I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I won &apos;t check anything here because it is disgu@@ sting in@@ doors here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to check them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty dishes on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all surv@@ eyed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys before del@@ o@@ gation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their council after a del@@ o@@ gation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ on and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing association &apos;s employees shocked the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were perfor@@ ated , wooden plan@@ ks were torn down , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared at the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this estate will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dated residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ fe and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ on , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn apart
neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ iled her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying to the police are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have om@@ itted the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant would agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gation is always the last step taking into account Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information we have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the floor .
workers in the house management will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ on received a fine , after she ple@@ aded guilty to the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money for a grav@@ estone of her son was Lee Skel@@ done , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti coated .
the police say that they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not cling to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that del@@ o@@ gation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ ger@@ ed after an eff@@ er@@ ves@@ cent military jet fly over the beach
sun seek@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese p @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of air forces placed an incredible crash
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no safety risk .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ent jet drops across a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holi@@ day@@ makers sprang up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle acts , without first seeing what came up through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers , who posted videos about the dramatic flying by @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro encomp@@ assed panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on Madeira island came to death .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke .
the airplane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish super@@ cup towards the FC Sev@@ ille , the back@@ lash three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner needs to disp@@ ense with the inferior Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European league champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee during the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least initially in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
so far , Coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applications ki@@ cked off .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool to 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ mo stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince him .
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with the past eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in its own league table to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Table Tennis Olympic Champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) in a one @-@ sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this the world @-@ ranking leader got the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tour@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title of each other .
so it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs they had no coaches in themselves .
they had withdrawn from the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches to this place for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fin@@ als I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he determined the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
nevertheless , there were nevertheless enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ rab@@ ani won the bronze play against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ Russian had contracted a ri@@ b injury , after that it was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have been in similar high table tennis organis@@ ers Olympic @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses to his campaign in the former Republi@@ can High Castle U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ leg@@ ged and self @-@ confident multi@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own republi@@ can camp , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians asking for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shaking Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey by surv@@ ey@@ United States of June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were on the same level .
other institutes look for@@ wards but not by far , which is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered .
in an interview with the sender CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it is al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump Party is said to have threatened to cancel money to support his campaign , he should not be able to present better survey values .
instead , the Republi@@ cans &apos; candidates for Congress would be stronger than the poor .
Olympia : triple che@@ ating at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after a fraud test at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials had told that the former spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the leadership of K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to do its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker assigned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will assess an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF @-@ statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , handed over and signed the sample , &quot; stated Ken@@ yan CEO Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was in Beijing World Cup fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
according to media reports , he was allegedly arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
since a long time , Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls launched by the IO@@ C prior to the Rio games , it was reported previously that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country in front of the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms to the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this type of sport it became widespread and systematic .
Russia &apos;s athletes have been exp@@ elled from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temples of classical music and fulfilled a youth room with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she reminds herself of her love with Tony while the younger sister plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is therefore smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli res@@ ig@@ ns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ories have gone to New York and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as powerful today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school maid who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London went to an airplane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in case of electoral victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked their endor@@ sement by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is convinced that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; choose Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a Rei@@ d spokesperson later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not cause trouble with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , are lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ fit for the Pres@@ idency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to be neck calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to release Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine is distingu@@ ish@@ able from old@@ school play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes that it does the calendar as well .
&quot; we must return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish commun@@ e comp@@ utes with mass flight
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kur@@ dist@@ an community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the harsh attack of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dist@@ an community of Germany awaits a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand guards from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already covered Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with criminal charges months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing Turkey .
after the disgu@@ ised put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start again in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees by themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band@@ leader lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ mighty cities .
in this way Erdo@@ gan hopes to raise the expression on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stand as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len fan destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the paper reports on reference to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are no escap@@ ees from war , poverty or lack of perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
for sil@@ ly than hitherto it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the campaign champi@@ ons , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the way to Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a native , so you must not choose the country day .
in addition , there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end of votes .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday week , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign almost over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , needs to be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting will be how much newcom@@ er Af@@ D will cut off and what remains in the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign for election , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the right place at the wrong time .
Chancellor Angela Merkel has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel Bundestag election circuit is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , secretary general of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country , it crum@@ bles the base , that it must be very strict to find a connection to the people again .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any left in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election champion Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at election 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in surveys , are likely to make the leap into the land @-@ day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of their vac@@ ations and spread their campaign mostly into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls it the national pres@@ idents Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election champi@@ ons go to search for traces of local vocal ch@@ ords among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ings straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8@@ pm , there are everywhere praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything quite sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has again been made , the traffic situation in the village has eased .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the pass traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief conductor Florian King responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were looking and more familiar than the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks in residential areas was fran@@ ch@@ ised .
as the speed limits were not met , the congregation demanded reinfor@@ ces the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been baked .
the fastest speed was 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is now open for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to a decline in turnover gives everyone that is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the balance is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be glad about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he figures the revenue losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refur@@ bish@@ ment was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to dis@@ miss half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , politics would have re@@ acted otherwise .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner asked if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts , where something has been handled gener@@ ously .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history .
he can understand that other regul@@ ars look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful .
that his regular client@@ ele comes back to the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 construction works on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now proposes a thick safety package .
but what has a debt status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gi@@ veth satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the introduction of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was in a position and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time , before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still keeps this for reasonable and also demands nothing that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aining human beings from deport@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of D@@ ul@@ ling for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers out to mask their identity .
some of these are politically and legally sensitive .
some also have an unpleasant effect and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg attacks were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that the people were deeply involved did not let themselves be cl@@ inging to election events .
the inner security is hu@@ gely moved into focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attack in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves in place on the issue of inner security .
in the past few days there was a high rise between the two parties .
only a stub@@ born dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department heads also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he has nothing of a departure from the double pass .
we were satisfied with the discussion in Germany .
it is not advisable to re@@ open it .
and in case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he has no constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things that might cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ long itself in the issue of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still flying gli@@ bly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , deliveries are increasing worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tices about a term .
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year with the deliveries .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest autom@@ aker can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand VW decreased mainly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales as announced by the company in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
only in Western Europe , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market Germany deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
head of marketing Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July particularly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a reluc@@ tance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for leaving the EU also bur@@ dened , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust air was escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus too .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected home brand of the Lower Saxony is bo@@ gged down by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales Chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to forward a sales loan from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling approximately 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
following the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer guarantees a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal fre@@ edoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion have no deterior@@ ations and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come into a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and that could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interests it is important to avoid that with any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is calling for a second institute in Germany from wealthy depos@@ itors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not have to be afraid of paying pen@@ alties for their austerity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
this charge applies to Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits more than € 100,000 in deposit or daily allow@@ ance accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been paying 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and that he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle he now passes on the costs .
leaving the cash simply in the bank of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank officer .
most customers should understand and switch to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association of co @-@ operatives declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank @-@ branch 2014 made head@@ lines with p@@ enti@@ t@@ ines for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is endow@@ ed with wealth a bit more luxuri@@ antly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if she pays for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no further banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association of Co@@ operatives of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calculate a compensation for private customers &quot; deposits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be pleased with this .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before you rush to the comment section , under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Not Alle@@ gr@@ ate Men &apos;s Middle Age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ birth of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but also to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a plate are all for@@ ek@@ now@@ ledge at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hormone caused by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older sal@@ es@@ men retain their feelings rather ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffed before I stop , hold my hands and say something better , &quot; So , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the camera man to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , the walls of his living room are suffering .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and re @-@ sell items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I guess was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy back their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the contact with the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects that call for happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like this for many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ ats from a stack of sheets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an IC@@ M survey revealed in April that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very anxi@@ ous while I smo@@ other through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( counts : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ consuming , less musical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come first slowly .
opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts introduces the latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ un@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks particularly lonely , but the psychological trauma is hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it &apos;s more like a window shop than a big shopping cart .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to pattern the pants hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ed for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and sending some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards .
even if my research suggests that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave un@@ accounted for , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bees through plat@@ es@@ ies of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while avoiding the star@@ ry look of an unc@@ anny , thirty @-@ year old wrong facilit@@ ator who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men across the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of stores in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to submit 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to final drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be broken down because they would constitute a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court that shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by tear@@ ing down was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lager , which is operated in general and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin stays comb@@ ative
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ prof@@ i will not want to let Tony Martin get lost .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and continue to fight , &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro near Facebook .
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me it is hon@@ estly difficult to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time @-@ held World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we &apos;ve changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time World Champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flashes are tested , which are intended to be used particularly effectively .
the Fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ looking Enfor@@ cement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , on accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that speed limits are maintained with a stationary heater .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement operations , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer by car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply ch@@ ewed , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally slip @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the heater from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year .
great Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ franc rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in the handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ah@@ e@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but irrespective of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten up a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB has had a difficult path .
eight years ago Ry@@ an lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks boun@@ ce out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au spread across the corner .
with another four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a h@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute An@@ em@@ al@@ ua ran a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ play and there was still over a minute play@@ time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u tor@@ ches through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while the UK still has to learn .
this is how it is .
GB led basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ af@@ sul@@ an , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked down in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton went through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than these games , and that will mean what .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic lion in a row without a control woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , who placed such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9th in@@ decent commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers that make the difference , and no one was more helpful than the coach , who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that can be operated and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it will spread everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing itself is a challenge , but this makes it an even larger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning to talk something more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any races over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , p@@ anning and glob@@ es were too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en cried &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to do something ra@@ bies .
today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary in Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water purpose association as a model for the large producers of water .
this was the name of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos;s contribution some time ago .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia was dig@@ ging the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband Emplo@@ ye@@ e Emplo@@ ye@@ e , 28 years of age as managing director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , annually supports approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the commun@@ es are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ n , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water line construction and maintenance work on office and organizational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to contin@@ gency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for the farmers , the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ purchase of water pipes .
there have been no stal@@ em@@ ate and I have always added new additions because water supplies life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her eu@@ logy she engaged Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water pur@@ se association and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he presented the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for the reduction of nit@@ rate in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia water forum .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller also praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best Aquari@@ us and he was a faithful knob .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the fountain and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ federation .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the rup@@ ture at the high @-@ level can@@ ister at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n could be maintained only because one filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .

&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now lear@@ ns privately in New York where the best therapists are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that lies two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and killed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated that his partner was shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly punished .
now nationwide , because Sven S. might be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald head .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man has a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , like the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to give information about the attack or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but she confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say any more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that thre@@ aten the industry from green power are from the table .
it remains with the exemp@@ tion from the Renewable Energy Division in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but also this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for the production of electricity .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely as@@ cri@@ bed .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation became more acute when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw heavy steel on the world market in the face of the slu@@ gg@@ ish domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel conc@@ er@@ tos of price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat eased .
on the one hand , tra@@ ded import duties on import steel have effects , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how long lasting the price @-@ collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Division announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , mind , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher training programme she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing is moving - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way she does something good with her health and mind .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because social and family structures often dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and to organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who challenges his lungs regularly does not get out of the pu@@ ff as quickly as possible in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
singing often has a very special effect on older people , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing songs w@@ akes many memories in older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
due to lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia @-@ infected people de@@ vise in long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz .
focusing simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the chor@@ us , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I will get better and grow up over myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &apos; choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many amateur choirs can also be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help from the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good for the soul and has something eman@@ ating - this is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to cri@@ es of k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect the so@@ ot of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust did not leave the males cold - however they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react at ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens that are in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cri@@ bs differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ lication of little ones taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the more excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or evol@@ ves with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already resear@@ ched the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ esses &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
prior to the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ inski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even at the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens , should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not done before football .
against the former Str@@ ong Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant .
according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r is to be the follow@@ er of the minister Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially returned to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne presented its sporty value in the past season : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g it only reached rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year went better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season drivers as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ revi@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
on the other hand , the Gom@@ ez , which stood on the contract at AC Florence , had only announced Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has quoted Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to refrain from around a third of his annual salary valued at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was blocked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other le@@ aded athletes can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had acc@@ ented herself shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was pi@@ ped out and rested upon her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it offered itself a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with a set smile she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when he found out that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a shou@@ ting tower .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m as@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion has been running even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to reti@@ re in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m as@@ el / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two times world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and locked 21 months .
a means for penis enlargement has been responsible , regre@@ t@@ ted mer@@ ging .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world for over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fest , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ lete was retro@@ spec@@ tively recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment issued by the International Sports Court of Justice ( CA@@ S ) .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km going , China ) : the world record holder and gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but can still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion had found evidence of taking a banned food supplement , the barrier to the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and was already running on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I was able to leave it again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether there are also Austrian citizens affected by the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll explains .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok capital , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again two explo@@ sives came up , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported at Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured at the det@@ onation near the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , popular among vac@@ ation@@ ers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower @-@ be@@ et in front of the territory of the territorial police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast called for several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves with possible motives - but it is likely to be the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were put in place .
in recent days , the authorities would have received secret references to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed its officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they do not usually turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the alleged bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , no need to travel to these provinces is denied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits a great influence to the military in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country shifted towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , maintains itself well to have the kingdom restored to stability and order .
however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok at one stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Secretary Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed extrem@@ ly .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; multic@@ ultur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
the &quot; Identi@@ ty shareholders &quot; are already observing the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ eating said that his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts in general try to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
that would do Islam@@ ists as well as right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real publicity for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should emo@@ tionally appeal to people .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to attack .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently , reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been made up of several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ eating said he had no knowledge .
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for constitutional protection from a certain point onwards .
it depends on whether or not the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodation , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ tic motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be discern@@ ed .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many transgres@@ sions went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attack on asylum lod@@ g@@ ings had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who perhaps were politically in@@ different , or have voted for example the CD@@ U , the SPD or the left , which , however , radic@@ alised itself by far @-@ right extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight flo@@ ater from Ethiopia so slow that it could not be seen in the TV pictures at times .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , having just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ ots der W@@ al . &quot;
based on a &quot; prosperity b@@ auch &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him .
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i &apos;s race attracted media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy of Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a subur@@ b of 100 metres .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before Olympia for eight months and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a campaign rally in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .

within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post climb@@ s into the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the Post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
the company will shortly start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric @-@ transpor@@ ters on the free car market from next year onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post office spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed sco@@ ot@@ ers , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always ques@@ tioning , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its electric cars fleet and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will take a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP management res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research firm Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ slides came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research firm Gf@@ K revealed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more un@@ safe , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate governance , the global number five in the industry is facing a new beginning .
GF@@ RP Managing Director plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahler is already leaving the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
the management board members Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , former board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , will take the lead as early as 1 September .
he will officially take over the function of a &quot; Bureau @-@ Spe@@ aker , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is unclear who will lead the market research company in the future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were at last the disappointment of the continuing success of the restructuring initiated several years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder is going to be un@@ steady at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this was the case with BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company also failed to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros increased by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the decreased value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s sales of EUR 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the line .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Aur@@ ich ) , eight people were injured in an accident of a coach with 43 elderly passengers .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , told the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to his indications , had to avoid a truck coming in the opposite direction .
the bus stopped right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the scene of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ hurt travellers were brought back by a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of sewage amount to Euro 3.@@ 44 as of 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3.@@ 44 euros ; for Zul@@ te berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ over 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a trans@@ lu@@ cent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Unter@@ deck@@ ungen were established for these sewage plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also overl@@ aps and under@@ tak@@ ings from the previous calculation period .
thanks to the serious charges increases , Schmidt explained that all three wastewater facilities are relatively small facilities with a very low sewage use , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect on account of the low distribution basis .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to their age , renovation and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent in all three plants .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the waste water system Az@@ endorf .
at the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed after nearly 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to meet the requirements of water law in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewage use in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of large maintenance costs in the waste water facilities , has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach valley wastewater treatment association could not be expanded because these facilities are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly rate of inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , compared to the previous month , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic drinks and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ un@@ chy , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate over 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
snap@@ shots filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were bl@@ amed that the app would promote black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter , which gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es were pointing to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage was widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat informed that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was designed to pay tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vulnerable and said to be unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was pulled into the de@@ valu@@ ing extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tri@@ pping .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audiences of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterpart - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters produces an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ ameri@@ can Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that left Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a HR manager focusing on sub@@ servi@@ ent population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu , for their part , said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fy IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Army Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Military Com@@ mit@@ t , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their app@@ rais@@ als to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ based information , typically riv@@ alled by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site had allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , a republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government spi@@ kes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com subscri@@ ber publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ s@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to run the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans launched the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Supreme Democrats in the Committee , Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ ale among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ s@@ enting opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and democr@@ ats gave no clu@@ e to the White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor who received Cent@@ Com analy@@ st complaints .
Mr. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging views on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s alleg@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State was reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial position as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command@@ l@@ sh@@ aber , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA gains fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after having scored three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that they had ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer , leading the other group .
whatever the game looks like on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising turbul@@ ence by their success story , four years after they ended up with the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey player in his hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ space in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough , holding the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it carried out a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and sli@@ pped the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I think you can make arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline market has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many of them , I had questioned , did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline market and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially combines it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ erc@@ ing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ round@@ ly athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go on in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but in the TV transmission also another scor@@ ched goal : those of the world or of the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even touch a spect@@ ator with tears .
but it is also what I feel more fati@@ gu@@ ing when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back upwards .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and end @-@ hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
amid the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the pro@@ curing and obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner suggested recently - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air @-@ bearing , new fan community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demanding political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ hed with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more territories .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that police fired on dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed them .
videos circul@@ ating about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or driven to the v@@ ast@@ ness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the governing coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , could use tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ ns under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved .
even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians declared that they assembled so many protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , have prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while explo@@ iting the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
contrary to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a revol@@ t was in 2005 after thousands protest against elections which , according to information by analysts , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and were stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train and for their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters interven@@ ed in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ischen city , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbouring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , to explain the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump with@@ drew in terms of the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning ts@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump told him he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down upon Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling re@@ perc@@ ussions on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this subject again .
reporting on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he felt strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course I said that sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then ru@@ de back as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more caus@@ tic tone as its survey values have declined further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is stepping up the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave a great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Giuli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ yards , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of breaking on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who tried to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ uses as only a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
once overwhel@@ med by the price of the market , the café returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a small cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , excluding Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when New York is changing , it is also new finding .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide cash for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a great deal .
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and pick@@ led onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also driven by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , used to live in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb was closed , she gave up a drink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ time and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for spo@@ iling with the coffee of coffee in the coffee bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entrance to the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on this day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the US , while bri@@ ck@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
her latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
as the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ery , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which extends the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
men &apos;s teams cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways in which the country was going to stop being the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cock@@ aig@@ ne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans was a central , focused theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , re@@ covering the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Arm@@ man noted , as chefs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely servi@@ ved luxury .
peculiar bl@@ ends have been tried out , because a calorie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen @-@ sense .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from that time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
like never before or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics - between 1923 and 1943 served as the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge of transforming P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake food pose .
while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa rural house kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million @-@ million@@ aire man from the world to which he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wearing a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mr@@ s Roos@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House brought about the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the storm of wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s farm , they pulled out a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which was eaten by President Roos@@ ev@@ elt for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to give a chic name to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E took a sur@@ ge three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 lives so far .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian protecting him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven men suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland hair@@ s usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie only gets up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it gets on average just 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it matters is the five @-@ meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock that life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist believed long ago that Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
they measured their time @-@ slow pent@@ ag@@ ons when they exp@@ elled six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
prey make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses that are tor@@ ped@@ o@@ ed from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland h@@ arks , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the contained proteins are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons prolifer@@ ated large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
in their lens nucle@@ us all the larger Greenland @-@ hair@@ s had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old at 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to al@@ locate the length of an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
the fact that these kinds of methane live in icy waters is not a coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland @-@ wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on stuck to the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often especially large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more in a long life .
building plot in a double pack
the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on issues relating to construction in the most recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of newly designated living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plot of land , plot and clearance issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on surve@@ ying , there is nothing more in the way to the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) .
the municipal council is convinced that the cultivation areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ vil@@ lige can now announce themselves in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to be able to meet requests concerning the settlement of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
for example , the commercial area that has already been proven there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies reloc@@ ated from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is sufficient for approval in the UK so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they just use large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk management .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg has a large fund business , it also deterior@@ ates worse with the infrastructure in its infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further points are the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are also 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the company &apos;s consultancy Merc@@ er , the city is standing in seventh place , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th position .
even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; concludes the I@@ W .
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists .
the balance of power also speaks for this : in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent conflict with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. official judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc would be entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two Mer@@ ck patents , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , US counterpart , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of the costs arising during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck lam@@ ented each other and claim ownership of laboratory work that Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir inf@@ ring@@ ed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops backed by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently comb@@ ing the city after the removal of the still remaining group of fighters buried within the city .
they delivered more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are making straight up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ker &apos;s income of CHF 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton released its 2015 tax return on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton USD 1 million donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated $ 5.3 million in free speech pairs . the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million to her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement .
in stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and dec@@ ei@@ vers in terms of his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for ref@@ using a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s election hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump sum@@ mon@@ ed him to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke to the topic even during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very low taxes , and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax attor@@ neys and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat , called Tr@@ ump to meet their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an I@@ RS tax check and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published a tax return back to the year 2007 .
the clin@@ ker living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York now paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only occupied USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most of the Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years ago , intensified its funding together with the U.S. nature conservation by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World Economic Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without hur@@ ting the elephant in doing so , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chill@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chill@@ i powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom sp@@ ans with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on chil@@ i powder into the air .
a touch quite usually comes out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last possibility is a laun@@ cher that shoots a gold @-@ fired kil@@ n into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .

however , the Municipal Council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales office on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bo@@ k@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk discre@@ et@@ ly fits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots released a media watch , after betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election as it would have requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of countries .
the country , however , was not listed between the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
following an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is extingu@@ ished , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
that is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
that needs no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged appeals of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel soon rejected all alleg@@ ations of itself and called the incident an &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to include Israel in the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now being added .
police pos@@ ses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , leading to the fact that the police put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti painting against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests erup@@ ted a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been reli@@ eved of their occupation by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is starting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian representation abroad gave some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the Ambassador believes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses wanted : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl inf@@ ested
a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y was on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ger Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had surrounded their faces , issued cash from the drink market staff and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured , the police do not share with them .
the perpet@@ rators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres in size , relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
after the attack , the perpet@@ rators must travel to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel car@@ park in front of the car park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have observed at the crime time ( at 7.@@ 45 pm ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should urgently notify the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection alliance Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors at their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet Lei@@ theim hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ king .
children and car@@ egi@@ vers were treated with their self @-@ prepared body@@ shells such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .

the altar boys from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were accomplished together .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ pu@@ Pil@@ gri@@ mage of all the mini @-@ stran@@ ts for two years , the upper mini@@ stries round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the hal@@ ves of God made their way .
in the evening previously priest stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and informed the pilgri@@ m sa@@ ils .
from Hor@@ b we went by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster was Our Lady and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was ki@@ cked off from Münster .
each day and evening the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and text texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is of Feld@@ kir@@ ch , Kap@@ ellen or churches repeatedly made a stop@@ over to sing a song of specially arranged pilgrims song .
for the overnight stays , the parish offices of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the finishing points Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but initially had to drop down some 500 metres in altitude and then be heard again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue at the beach in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
God thank@@ ed God with a small impulse .
in the evening mass in Münster the min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t arrived at the pilgrimage destination .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all the participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold rings for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced at the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London in 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow had the anchor that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to be . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a win from New Zealand &apos;s favorites .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos; res@@ ignation .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retired created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that had un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner seats in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des succ@@ um@@ bed to his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that led Hin@@ ds in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and beat the world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling off the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with the whole GB flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of the possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would mean Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a spo@@ ils of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he argued with delegates before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ ell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e , advanced to 4 : 13,@@ 260 in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow .
the GB team relies on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
dra@@ mas were playing in the background , following the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April amid sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ bling and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melt of Port@@ land due to the lifting of energy demand question@@ able
the future of aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby canc@@ els all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2000 jobs at the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting mill with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging businesses , &quot; which should have come into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the Tre@@ aties in its annual depreciation of $ 18@@ 7 million in anticip@@ ation of a termination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts and some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity a year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a car@@ th@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a wei@@ rd ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , cri@@ p@@ pled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é act of nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with a view to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of cardi@@ opul@@ ence has begun .
she likes the Vo@@ gue cover , she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West have been on it in April 2014 , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles a picture book as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover @-@ star is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the journal still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda G@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even if all of it applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings turned up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to get around on the m@@ ess seems to pass by the point .
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells paintings by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is shown in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centres annually show 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary units are reported annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected on their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are prepared for further cuts .
from June next year it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the Director of the District Church of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Research Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that without a suspension of the resolution of the Federal Government , the situation would only get worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need will be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dis@@ missed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the assistance they need in case of legal problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers &apos; community and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n accused of Staff allegedly drew weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was shooting a fire@@ arm on a staff in February , while in February they were travelling in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the National Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and took the barrel in Vinc@@ enzo &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not address violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s appeal demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence and of Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip did not fail as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on EU Elec@@ tions : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) there are considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black governing coalition could not go@@ vern further in the north , this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin .
the SPD , however , would be the strongest party in both states and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD decreased from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just barely ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would rise to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens still hes@@ itated by 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
the N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag , each with 3 percent .
according to the survey , the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they still leave the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties at 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would , in contrast to 2011 , miss the move .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
today the success@@ ors dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies at high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , though tor@@ ment@@ ing slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone line of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by providers , all of whom came later as Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is everyday for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac world announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen is easy to use .
the trium@@ ph@@ al march of Apple began , the iPhone is still the most important product of the group today .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the re@@ viewing .
they disappeared eventually , black@@ berry has to fight .
the legends now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today each German is looking for his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ unders were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to bequ@@ e@@ ath the legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul D@@ eigh@@ ton is Chairman of He@@ ath@@ row Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treas@@ ury .
Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking
according to one of the software manufacturers , companies who earn money with online advertising make attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cra@@ b and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ing on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it informed that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop site would change coding with respect to its advertisements to make it harder to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the line @-@ up open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has already been in progress since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook is soon to come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worried ad block@@ ers have become the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , there are about 200 million people display blo@@ cker ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebook .
apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker shared with them .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to give more control over people &apos;s hands .
woman suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday over@@ took a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who call this and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical step in such a situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent murder after she over@@ came and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call - drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was likely inhab@@ itable .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun &apos;s daily out@@ flow for almost two months , &quot; explained scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought by planet explor@@ ers .
although it was once believed to be resident , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers found the results of their new Venus Climate Models at the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ned as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday , leading to low co @-@ determination in the decision making process of the team .
alternative president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly tailored to the organisation &apos;s requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years the post season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spotlight at the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wage struggles with respect to wages for North Sea workers will be suspended , as all the parties of the conflict put themselves on the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that extra cuts will give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that intensified by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson joined workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week in order to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary creation .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star@@ ters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are turning the fastest now .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars b@@ ump up large amounts of star@@ vation .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ light -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , When and Why Star will slow down their rotation rates and so to speak , hang up their dance shoes .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports extensively about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez &apos;s tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base zu Base .
after his emotional release , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will take the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thri@@ ce Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen to be the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez continued to pay back with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
nevertheless , the 41 year old should not be admitted to the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for as successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , his appearance outside of the place is controversial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as early as 2009 , the Super@@ star admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 ster@@ oids were banned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting means for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done me a favour in 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Sou@@ ff@@ is@@ ant at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his f@@ arewell @-@ days do not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and re@@ affir@@ med the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympath@@ ies with the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ality Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
catch : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not be allowed to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a caught ath@@ lete would almost have won a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news is coming to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 year old had the fourth place in the final 100 m butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have taken part in the course of 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial Chamber and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news spread out about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to deal with the forbidden substance of the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately contacted the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested just like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before .
both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the launch of athletes is especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova , another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the global association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in swimming sports , the former tre@@ aties in China also caused serious conflicts between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of an examination of the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese Championships for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ acker their ran@@ som
manufacturers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey by the malware @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , in part several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims readily paid the holes demanded by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators are notic@@ e@@ ably speci@@ alizing in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som will be considerably higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of malicious software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was done quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
afterwards , the software presents the demands of the black@@ boards .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ utri@@ ung Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are talking about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
as a result , the damage drops if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to stop business operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the light of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for free example files .
and will be replaced by individuals after payment of a few hundred euros , companies must partly trade hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely , however , that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual ex@@ tor@@ tion .
the previous malware kits have been created by purchasing malware , consulting , and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included is a matching tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; said Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ heads are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is done per certified computer .
&quot; usually criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski declares .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malay@@ sian print media survey trusted that using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful capture , the perpet@@ rators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damage depending on the type of data is much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could take completely new targets on the net of things in the Internet .
at the Def@@ con h@@ acker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators , instead of heating in the future , block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versatility of a Mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top drops down somewhat .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l in inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment is nothing to be desired in the top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and stran@@ g@@ les the speed if necessary .
however , full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest too much will receive the petrol engine from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in the event of dangers which are typical for aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee injury .
however , the accident could have passed all over - it is a general risk of living , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
case of sickness : when does the organizer pay
sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of a hearing , a family on the second day of their door@@ step was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective water treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was so defici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not have any success in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
in other words , he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdict .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with each other - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to respond to terrorist attacks .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to terrorists .
if criminals have to leave the country faster , this will increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of the proposals until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon law will be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last widely discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to remain protected after de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctor in order to reduce the risk of citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to use concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of dual nationality .
a general ban on full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional law .
you cannot ban everything you reject , and I refuse to wear the bur@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talk about rules about traffic or witnesses against court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
green editor Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the Minister that he wanted to simulate action and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it looks regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but that is to change : the legal remedy should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding street every evening in traffic jams when driving over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the descent Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ off track by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is divided early on , whereby the entire course of the cycle is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of the city of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ yard stretches up to the bridge over the Alber@@ go trail and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here on , traffic is only driven in a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled more than three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy @-@ load traffic in particular .
the competent state operation cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic will continue .
however , years have to be expected : the bridge has an official remaining period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal service charge , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
traffic is conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday on the construction site .
intercultural Journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the young@@ sters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language transfer are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made a das@@ h of the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night for a das@@ h - but there is still hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sil@@ den , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep well before the alarm bells .
this is anything but relaxing .
at least one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adults sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems and sleep disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and it can under@@ lie a variety of causes , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what you mean by land@@ ings is the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore a distur@@ b@@ ance and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
when it comes to sleeping many people feel un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board at the German GP association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially frequent when it comes to depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that various factors condition each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie ill , wake up every two to three hours and may start to smile about everyday problems and worries .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired in the day should go to the doctor , gu@@ essing .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : you have been beaten , tired , uncomfortable , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep problems it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there are hardly settled medi@@ cam@@ ents in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary Sle@@ eping Medical Center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should contact the family doctor first ,
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
in the sleep laboratory examination , medical professionals advise for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory stimul@@ ants , in case of abnormal fatigue , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or when one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains .
you do not have to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping place on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
she counts : regular sleep and rise @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is not really condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the Short Path World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € award and a jungle king of € 15@@ 0,000 should be surprised nobody about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old said in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sponsor@@ ing system in swimming is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not exactly see or even operate on the subject of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent controllers in WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : ban@@ des arrested by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police of Düsseldorf &apos;s police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the suspect had committed several t@@ asch@@ e- and luggage @-@ pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from last anti @-@ theft crimes .
the two women and two men have committed several crimes since mid @-@ July and have worked together in a collaborative , labour @-@ friendly manner and in a particularly professional way .
the specialists of the crime comm@@ iss@@ ary 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , who entered Germany especially for the off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences .
in the process , they had a total of over 15,000 Euro .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem like this at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes through play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her nur@@ sery and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , is already being built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
however , articles about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area referred to as the &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , police pat@@ rol the police for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew members on site , locked down parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , the renovated building workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others conver@@ se before Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children here , is generally anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern about rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted to call for a majority of police protection against a v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator and the police force between home occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which even today in comparison with the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , among them almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been put out under a large number of police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years the district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ uted head@@ liners from all over the world : people from the GDR times and former hous@@ em@@ akers are now sharing their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognis@@ able from a win@@ dow@@ ed pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours regards this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the crimes will make damage to property , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to violence , it &apos;s wei@@ ght@@ less : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they are certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer there directly in Riga .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remained .
that is why it was so important for her that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building gaps , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ dos which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well inf@@ used here are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are anno@@ yed by color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pub , can complain badly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee lecturer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person regarding integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been refugee officers in Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the administration team for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , who is above all a problem .
for example , some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an imposing Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organizing , working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent substitute for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine Kunde , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be in the washing line
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commun@@ e and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , administration does not find private apartments .
until now , it does not work so far as to rely on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community apartments must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fired or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine client reports .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not only mean job .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping here .
it is crucial that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
whoever will develop the feeling some@@ time , he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , customers say hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people in whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent events , also in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine &apos;s client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they fear that the assass@@ ins will bring them out completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the local and local volunteers will have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
at the same time , they have always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly is the policy .
actually it is unfair to make them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
