<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Pyramid of Sports" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even bother for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramids.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are at odds with the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep things small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively go back to regulations, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate says even the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, intends to extend and demand renewables with its investment programme: "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazilian trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then also be paid better, requires about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be rinsed, then he says that he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather more about the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics declared him that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton stands, who wants at least to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish opposite-player in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is the most willing to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be adorable and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launching of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was sore.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin informed and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To reconstruct the cousin becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily interested in all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his office during a failed coup d'etat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, national TV predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, since it considers his reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "the continued resentment of the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state secured a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that feel driven from the West and feel ill treated and now faded.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria where Moscow recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they would not even have stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk to each other at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin Moves Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin it is said that Putin has ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian President without giving reasons for" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that later it was the head of the government and the staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in terms of bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces persuade?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and worked for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at one time would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - confidently entrust it to this post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">How it turns out I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia because a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another well-known ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sloping cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing a truly epic achievement in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete bath in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure is a trend-setting high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern turtle, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - they were just a few millimetres on each side.</seg>

<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem," "" "said Bratmann," "" "There is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make as few rules as possible for investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, so Bratmann embarks on a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not quite complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compensate for the loss of other around 1300 affordable housing that will run out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planned actress Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, one distances oneself from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been complained by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons to be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the cock and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people, who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take "30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elend.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also angry playing corrupters who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, more fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now also Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast took off on Thursday for the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team fellow Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the American women Simone Biles" "" "performs on the Swedish bar during the single multi-campaign of women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth, while she reinforces her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman huddled after winning both gold and silver in the single multi-competition ale of women in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retiring man Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia Arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gymnasium in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has won no more competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa led through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedes and Boehurns - in which Biles holds the world title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and put on top of it with a 15.933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears streaming on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which is called "OMA," by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her practice she overcame the audience of Kusshes, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present under the women's olympia office in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflecting the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America jubeled.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly gyrating routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see trainers all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gymnastics clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are in prosperous suburbs who can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer to the communes innumerable young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easier accessible turn-up training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics institute of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (above all black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the dismissal of a government report on corruption from office</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet electoral scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court decided that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany on corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>

<seg id="18">He expressed particularly alarming to the fraudulent letter of letters - in which the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it is said: "evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subdued his immune system and the stranglehold of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk turned his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a drawbar of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking each object, he used a luminometer to show up and show us what it is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results to light." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of detecting the rinsing button of a drawstring that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left behind him, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds at railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometer number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject after her luminometer number was more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "That's coming close to the worst that I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't check anything here because it is disgusting indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to check them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty dishes on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their council after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, the housing association's employees shocked the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were perforated, wooden planks were torn down, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared at the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was a nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this estate will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bats, intimidated residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strife and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn apart</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police to be invoked.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have omitted the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant would agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogation is always the last step taking into account Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be awful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information we have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behavior is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the walls of the house were graffiti coated.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delegate tenants who do not cling to the house rules</seg>

<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan officials had told that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the leadership of Kenias by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to do its own investigations, an IAAF speaker assigned.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IOC, the IAAF will assess an assessment," "" "he said in an IAAF-statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich, handed over and signed the sample," stated Kenyan CEO Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing World Cup fourth more than 800 meters in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.</seg>

<seg id="17">At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls launched by the IOC prior to the Rio games, it was reported previously that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country in front of the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For silly than hitherto it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaign champions, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not a native, so you must not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end of votes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday week, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign almost over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, needs to be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting will be how much newcomer AfD will cut off and what remains in the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign for election, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatted a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create this" "" "accelerates the rise of the right populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry now." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chancellor Angela Merkel has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel Bundestag election circuit is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely eliminates the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, according to Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country, it crumbles the base, that it must be very strict to find a connection to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any left in the expanse of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU election champion Kokert to his comrades is also self-revealing:" "" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party needs to be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At election 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in surveys, are likely to make the leap into the land-day." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their vacations and spread their campaign mostly into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "", "calls it the national presidents Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election champions go to search for traces of local vocal chords among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvings straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8pm, there are everywhere praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they made everything quite shaky," "" "said Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">Praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has again been made, the traffic situation in the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pass traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," says the deputy chief conductor Florian King responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were looking and more familiar than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some trucks in residential areas was franchised.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that the road is now open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a decline in turnover gives everyone that is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every euro sales.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road refurbishment was" "" "thrown back for two years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner asked if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts, where something has been handled generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regulars look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his regular clientele comes back to the end of the restoration work, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu, Göhner holds the impact of B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, under the pseudonym Not Allegrate Men's Middle Age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the rebirth of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but also to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all foreknowledge at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone caused by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older salesmen retain their feelings rather (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly stuffed before I stop, hold my hands and say something better, "So, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), the walls of his living room are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and re-sell items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I guess was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe, people who heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contact with the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that call for happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's like this for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee floats from a stack of sheets." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey revealed in April that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very anxious while I smoother through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (counts: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," I don't own record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-consuming, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come first slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a lower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops, Wild Beasts introduces the latest synthesizer and sexunpacked pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks particularly lonely, but the psychological trauma is hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more like a window shop than a big shopping cart.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to pattern the pants hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouped for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and sending some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research suggests that the results of YouGov vote, they leave unaccounted for, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumblebees through platesies of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while avoiding the starry look of an uncanny, thirty-year old wrong facilitator who raises nothing of middle-aged men across the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to submit 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to final drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be broken down because they would constitute a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "were absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lager, which is operated in general and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure" "" "for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of fijis when they were defeated with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiahedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji would have beaten up a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB has had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago Ryan lost each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and let the attacks bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau spread across the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Anemalua ran a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the replay and there was still over a minute playtime... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou torches through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play 7, while the UK still has to learn.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Seafsulan, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton went through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than these games, and that will mean what.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic lion in a row without a control woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, who placed such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39th indecent commitment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers that make the difference, and no one was more helpful than the coach, who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that can be operated and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it will spread everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but this makes it an even larger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wrecking morning to talk something more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, which was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much this means, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband Employee Employee, 28 years of age as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually supports approximately 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The communes are the municipalities of Kirchloun, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a Wasserwart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>

<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation for the farmers, the refurbishment of the high tank (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the repurchase of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no stalemate and I have always added new additions because water supplies life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her eulogy she engaged Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water purse association and he has literally lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he presented the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for the reduction of nitrate in front of the Lower Franconia water forum.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller also praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threaten the industry from green power are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the exemption from the Renewable Energy Division in the existing systems for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" West German Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for the production of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely ascribed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "also in the reform of the emissions trading scheme, climate and employment targets are to be weighed down," "" "stated IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation became more acute when the world's largest producer in China threw heavy steel on the world market in the face of the sluggish domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel concertos of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat eased.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, traded import duties on import steel have effects, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how long lasting the price-collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Division announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production is two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher training programme she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing is moving - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way she does something good with her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and to organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who challenges his lungs regularly does not get out of the puff as quickly as possible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs wakes many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-infected people devise in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing simultaneously on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the chorus, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I will get better and grow up over myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of a suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors' choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many amateur choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help from the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something emanating - this is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several injured.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were put in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have received secret references to imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed its officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they do not usually turn against tourists.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits a great influence to the military in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country shifted towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, maintains itself well to have the kingdom restored to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago in Bangkok at one stop at a popular Hindu shrine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight floater from Ethiopia so slow that it could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, having just wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Roots der Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">Based on a "prosperity bauch" the English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race attracted media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the buoyancy of Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a suburb of 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was frenetically fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic meter of sewage amount to Euro 3.44 as of 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welfare 3.44 euros; for Zulte berg / Lindenberg / Lover 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a translucent calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the District Office of Kulmbach, Unterdeckungen were established for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welsh ahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also overlaps and undertakings from the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to the serious charges increases, Schmidt explained that all three wastewater facilities are relatively small facilities with a very low sewage use, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect on account of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age, renovation and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh ahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the waste water system Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled by reason and the first sewage sludge had to be removed after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to meet the requirements of water law in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewage use in the three plants, expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully penetrated."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs in the waste water facilities, has been spared over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned facilities will remain precarious after the view of stone houses in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbach valley wastewater treatment association could not be expanded because these facilities are deficient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunchy, self-propelled tools that generate over 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshots filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were blamed that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter, which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies were pointing to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage was widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat informed that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was designed to pay tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was" "" "vulnerable and said to be unpleasant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was pulled into the devaluing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tripping.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audiences of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterpart - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters produces an image that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racist-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices in Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-american Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that left Snapchat largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a HR manager focusing on subservient population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="5">"intelligence-based information, typically rivalled by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site had allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, a republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," "" "the report stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom subscriber publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosssuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to run the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created a moderately restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "the Supreme Democrats in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the morale among analysts and" "" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and democrats gave no clue to the White House intervention in the CentCom analysts regarding a" "" "specific political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector who received CentCom analyst complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the general inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging views on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's allegations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State was reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position as these temporary refineries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damaliger Commandlshaber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that they had ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer, leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game looks like on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising turbulence by their success story, four years after they ended up with the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey player in his hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workspace in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough, holding the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and slipped the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the wristband to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I think you can make arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline market has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many of them, I had questioned, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline market and until 2012 had an athlete, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending bounce - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially combines it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, piercing and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to version, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-roundly athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go on in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but in the TV transmission also another scorched goal: those of the world or of the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even touch a spectator with tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel more fatiguing when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end-hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the procuring and objectification of male athletes - as the male US-Turner suggested recently - Mr. Dooley expects his air-bearing, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia clashed with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police fired on dozens of unarmed demonstrators and killed them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos circulating about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorists across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven to the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold on the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a battle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could use turmoil and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of Hinköchelns under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians declared that they assembled so many protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Contrary to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a revolt was in 2005 after thousands protest against elections which, according to information by analysts, were apparently pledged by the government and were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters intervened in Gondar, an amharischen city, managed by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West unequivocally wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans' presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, to explain the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew in terms of the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tsweet on Friday Mr. Trump told him he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down upon Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling repercussions on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he felt strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I said that sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rude back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more caustic tone as its survey values have declined further." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is stepping up the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave a great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "said Mr Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backyards, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of breaking on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who tried to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps excuses as only a further proof that he was unfit for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hairs usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haie only gets up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it gets on average just 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters is the five-meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland-shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"mad," Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock that life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist believed long ago that Greenland's sharks are stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their time-slow pentagons when they expelled six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and are looking for carcasses that are torpedoed from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland harks, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the sharks, the contained proteins are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons proliferated large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus all the larger Greenland-hairs had normal carbon-14 quantities, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark, while the record shark might be 392 years old at 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to allocate the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that these kinds of methane live in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon stuck to the neck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often especially large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were accomplished together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next RompuPilgrimage of all the mini-strants for two years, the upper ministries round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the halves of God made their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening previously priest storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and informed the pilgrim sails.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we went by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster was Our Lady and so the Pilgrimage was kicked off from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day and evening the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and text texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis of Feldkirch, Kapellen or churches repeatedly made a stopover to sing a song of specially arranged pilgrims song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays, the parish offices of the local parishes were available.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced at the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow had the anchor that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to be. he made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a win from New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys' resignation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that had unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner seats in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes succumbed to his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that led Hinds in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindu when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph at the Kenny and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling off the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said:" "" "it feels like London with the whole GB flags." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team for the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeats Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a spoils of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he argued with delegates before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie, advanced to 4: 13,260 in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas were playing in the background, following the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April amid sexism and mobbling and retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melting mill consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting mill with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the Treaties were so-called "hedging businesses," which should have come into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "for this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenues to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the Treaties in its annual depreciation of $187 million in anticipation of a termination.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché act of nearly every birthday episode of a children's program (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a view to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of cardiopulence has begun.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-funders were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth and to bequeath the legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks in the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to one of the software manufacturers, companies who earn money with online advertising make attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a "crab and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scoring on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it informed that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop site would change coding with respect to its advertisements to make it harder to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to circumvent new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her battle between the line-up open source community and the bypassing has already been in progress since the invention of ad lockers," and that Facebook is soon to come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worried ad blockers have become the industry.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday overtook a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>

<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something the prosecutor must decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the motorway, as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent murder after she overcame and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street, took the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policewoman -- who responded to an emergency call - drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was likely inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun's daily outflow for almost two months," explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once believed to be resident, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers found the results of their new Venus Climate Models at the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars revolve at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other starters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning the fastest now.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these ripening stars bump up large amounts of starvation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star age, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable starlight -- such as sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than a few massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turn slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athletics competitions this news is coming to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18 year old had the fourth place in the final 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the course of 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio the news spread out about the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive with it.</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to deal with the forbidden substance of the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately contacted the athlete with criticism.</seg>

<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested just like his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the launch of athletes is especially the case of Danekova, another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The global association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, even the Läufernation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in swimming sports, the former treaties in China also caused serious conflicts between the athletes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide blackmail hacker their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Manufacturers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware-defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, in part several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims readily paid the holes demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are noticeably specializing in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom will be considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of malicious software," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was done quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software presents the demands of the blackboards.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of Cryptoutriung Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are talking about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a result, the damage drops if a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 percent had even had to stop business operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the light of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be replaced by individuals after payment of a few hundred euros, companies must partly trade hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely, however, that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual extortion.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits have been created by purchasing malware, consulting, and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a matching tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," said Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackheads are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is done per certified computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually criminals employ spammers with spreading," Wisniewski declares.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malaysian print media survey trusted that using file-back-ups and scanner software to repel Ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damage depending on the type of data is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could take completely new targets on the net of things in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators, instead of heating in the future, block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a Minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top drops down somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l for raised and 1026 l in inverted backrests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment is nothing to be desired in the top" "" "Executive" "" "version." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates, because he evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when manoeuvring." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control responds to the traffic sign recognition and strangles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest too much will receive the petrol engine from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway bridge</seg>
<seg id="2">It looks regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: the legal remedy should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding street every evening in traffic jams when driving over the motorway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Road and the descent Weseler Straße the right-off track by 700 meters.</seg>

<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is divided early on, whereby the entire course of the cycle is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit was the CDU faction in the district of the city of Münster-West.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep well before the alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems and sleep disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and it can underlie a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what you mean by landings is the insomnia, therefore a disturbance and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it comes to sleeping many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board at the German GP association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially frequent when it comes to depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie ill, wake up every two to three hours and may start to smile about everyday problems and worries.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired in the day should go to the doctor, guessing.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: you have been beaten, tired, uncomfortable, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are hardly settled medicaments in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary Sleeping Medical Center at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should contact the family doctor first,</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In the sleep laboratory examination, medical professionals advise for example in snoring with respiratory stimulants, in case of abnormal fatigue, for sleepwalkers or when one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cladding, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping place on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">She counts: regular sleep and rise-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is not really conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police of Düsseldorf's police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspect had committed several tasche- and luggage-piles as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants in the area of the Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the policemen from last anti-theft crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men have committed several crimes since mid-July and have worked together in a collaborative, labour-friendly manner and in a particularly professional way.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the crime commissary 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves, who entered Germany especially for the offence of criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the process, they had a total of over 15,000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between still a rest of cobblestones: the Rīga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes through playgrounds, a fresher nursery and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, articles about this "trendy neighbourhood," as the real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's inner senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area referred to as the "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, police patrol the police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew members on site, locked down parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the renovated building workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others converse before Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, is generally annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted to call for a majority of police protection against a vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin's inner senator and the police force between home occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which even today in comparison with the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, among them almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been put out under a large number of police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years the district has become a magnet for tourists and polluted headliners from all over the world: people from the GDR times and former housemakers are now sharing their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognisable from a windowed panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words" "" "left autonomous violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours regards this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the crimes will make damage to property, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "when it comes to violence, it's weightless: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they are certainly not." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer there directly in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former building gaps, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condos which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well infused here are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed by color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pub, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee lecturer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person regarding integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been refugee officers in Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the administration team for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving Wollmilksau, who is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less mocking than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an imposing Wollmilksau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent substitute for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "said Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be in the washing line</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it does not work so far as to rely on private apartments, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fired or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine client reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not only mean job.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever will develop the feeling sometime, he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems, customers say honestly," "" "people in whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent events, also in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "said Regine's client quite clearly," "" "what some people may call naïve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They fear that the assassins will bring them out completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "said Regine Kunde." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the local and local volunteers will have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the same time, they have always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to make them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
