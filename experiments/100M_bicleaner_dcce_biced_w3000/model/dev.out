Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington den@@ ies the ongoing settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal raised by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu received a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress , which was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with regard to the election in Israel at the time .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a slightly bul@@ ky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officers found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I am sorry I could und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police ch@@ ained him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who fi@@ anc@@ ée Lamb , said he seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found out Lam@@ bs when he sailed back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long@@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ton , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally wre@@ cked on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic@@ as@@ pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were sitting up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the University &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss indeed called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat beside me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the movie begins and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ing and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon said its response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again ur@@ ges all parties , including the UN Security Council , to join forces and to support inclusive talks to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the minist@@ erial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ itting up in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dis@@ missed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and starting to run their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans claimed they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first country of the nation state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters are accustomed to the idea .
when they expose their be@@ v@@ ings , Republi@@ can voters stop dr@@ um@@ ming for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l from the past week , four out of ten claim that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the final cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P voters see Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathering around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting the majority support .
before Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters support Tr@@ ump saying they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they match Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they match Tr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump will obviously also do it .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls to Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington as well .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; de@@ fi@@ antly anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg you can find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a floor house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double keeper in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well @-@ deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive victory in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
at his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller was awarded the generous aid of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who suffered a shot of the World Champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based spoken word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination , without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including against famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was born here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were induced too often by reloc@@ ation to the left of the left , Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k turned from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute world champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best occasions in half .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians came up with their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set con@@ i@@ fers .
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was deser@@ tion .
as for instance , when he steering a shot of ide@@ ye over the lan@@ tern ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New he let Guardi@@ ola defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero had given the green light only after the final training , said Mr. Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the but@@ ch@@ eted Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made one of them .
before the game it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans had apparently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : if there is no risk , the risk is fast .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers risk losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ ented by the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gum infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to the extent to which smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the risk of haz@@ ards falls back to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study leader H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health down to high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of age were affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking can increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists arrive at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer rests on lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity
arch@@ eological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called land mem@@ orials .
for all building projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn as a department for archaeological soil conservation .
in the third construction phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman is caught in the train station in Berlin , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , it carried out serious injuries to the federal police .
she was treated in a emergency doctor and brought to hospital by rescue personnel .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to strengthen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which clearly corresponds to more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de pre@@ tends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP is intended to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the United States and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against judgments .
until now , the parties involved agreed on arbit@@ rators with each other , and there was no claim against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion over the past few months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , comm@@ enting Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , according to his own data , she wants to work towards an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , driven mainly by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a type of parallel justice , using the companies to pol@@ lu@@ te damages on tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national legislation , or impose a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act have described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included key points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked out with other EU Trade ministers in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
the delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , which records his meticul@@ ously arranged songs .
where they came into being and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative asylum .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously closely to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift at any time into great opul@@ ent drift .
the rum@@ our is that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; is the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in consequence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine there has already appeared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and positively sets out certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected at the Prime Minister &apos;s question of suspen@@ se
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question and set himself up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and Labour MEPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as she is appointed member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet after his appointment and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commemor@@ ative ceremony celebrating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ grund Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a comment by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve the leadership of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pile up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements about the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes in order to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow working and pen@@ sion@@ ist minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from comb@@ ating both &quot; perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ism &quot; and the stri@@ fe with anti @-@ hooks , and instead endeav@@ oured to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the Prime Minister , will be represented if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is on the way abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson for the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply to data which showed a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s goal .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period in the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most solic@@ ited estim@@ ation since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover bid received by the rival company AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans followed Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates vor@@ m Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is hanging in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in since Monday evening .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a should sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the fans don &apos;t .
also Bie@@ ber herself does not .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
for the advertisement in the Super@@ market &apos;s advertising break , he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple @-@ company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ ks .

he is said to have captured more than 100 million people .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others emphasize that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to No. 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber herself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanon to the idea of potato twe@@ eter
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger joint owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then there is a barbecue grill in his store , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese must now be submitted to the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good .
met@@ cash launches campaign management campaign to combat algae inf@@ estation
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di upgrade in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA individual dealers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment passes its annual Investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA individual traders have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern Australia .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take over five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets , and will take away sales of all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA single @-@ buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , spoke at a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food stores , which have approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA individual traders , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction while printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler stri@@ ves , however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA individual traders in enhancing their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s leading business leader , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and charging refur@@ bish@@ ment programs to El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was ra@@ mp@@ ed by the not@@ orious exploration of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice through the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how to beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp ra@@ zed a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single , behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that , in my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan on the crucial preliminary ruling that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick made the ascent very quickly on which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to enter illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed on the fron@@ tier when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence hid for an unknown time in a strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the Mig@@ rants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts to the Hungarian pro@@ visi@@ oning police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days talks will have to take place with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c at a controversial meeting in Brussels not to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the rus@@ hed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency situation launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison workers were deployed during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees who are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradic@@ ts other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , into a crime . these laws also establish higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency status , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come down by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders has arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 were able to enter , but thousands remain outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the race against the ground .
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic constitu@@ ents say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant than any of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton keeps a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
their support with the men is clearly decreased , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back here .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years of age has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a major advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries nationwide say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled by her .
the views are more mixed with those who are not supporting Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters are saying this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the sel@@ f@@ ability are also quoted .
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is a second with this measurement , but the percentage you see as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , no single Democratic candidate or candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates generate good results in some important tra@@ its in voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
in general , the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being questioned during the term of office as Foreign Minister , most demo@@ cra@@ cies are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ing .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voters do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see nationwide as well as Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good management notes .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush show hon@@ esty best .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tr@@ ump in the country &apos;s survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l is eliminated and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen to the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in poll@@ s - with 19 % support from Republi@@ cans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for ques@@ tioning Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday , during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers in order to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer going to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ zophren@@ ic ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move across a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and asking Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the common good of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for Mor@@ el &apos;s Third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has reno@@ unc@@ ed its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rate
a rise in interest comes , and the hous@@ se will go down , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding .
thus representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so heavily emphasized that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , multiple variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can be volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets can be appropri@@ ated 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly up@@ war@@ dly - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP by 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rises in such a fragile economic backdrop can be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have set the year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all enhancement cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ öh@@ en set very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / lowering occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle , the start @-@ ups immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in the return of returns between longer and shorter bonds and result in a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit margins have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have out@@ performed 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity for their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will most lose , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers can see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ ca@@ ster for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ b@@ bing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also directed the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differenti@@ ate from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to order new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to get involved in engaging the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for a cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts the next time an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee @-@ pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since records began in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday stopped spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating , after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ its itself and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening .
the Black @-@ Friday Phen@@ om@@ enon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites over@@ threw .
experts believe Black Friday , where buyers be@@ ware of bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spending a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the Fashion Cha@@ ins in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia partly att@@ aches to the collapse of the huge Sau@@ dis Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale coffee .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed a sanc@@ tion over the family bin Laden &apos;s family company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed as a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central Pacific Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage than the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle at the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ addle to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who will continue to be the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today king Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have om@@ itted the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said the company &apos;s leadership was banned from abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the overthrow of the Cran@@ e , which collap@@ sed into a courtyard of the Great Mo@@ or , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the p@@ addle , which will take place later this month .
the bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group for not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround the Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the overthrow of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .

it is alleged that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their homes .
if you skill@@ fully interact with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today .
the British are increasingly occupied by craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their houses , according to the company &apos;s head behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offering services at low @-@ price prices , is now ob@@ sol@@ ete .
King@@ fis@@ her is therefore planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ rie said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are hit by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must shift this to a balance .
in principle , half of our clients are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dis@@ miss@@ al education .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in preliminary investigation that in 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants used mon@@ ies of association accounts that they could disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial means .
this fact divided the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that no asset was created at any time by the association .
the sports officials had only charged expenditure and the sports club for which they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told , in the bread @-@ car@@ ving of the chief financial audi@@ tor of the tax office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the loss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debt .
furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the payout of the expense allow@@ ances has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allow@@ ances was paid years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail shots appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the proceedings .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ agus split the two def@@ end@@ ants together , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail by the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial crisis , it was important that only the freedom of debt has been , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary inquiry about official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that had been set@@ backs , declared the def@@ end@@ ants .
this securities account entered the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e did not know for a long time .
then he said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor posed in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim recovery . &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association never had any harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent , he only charged o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
he added 1000 Euro per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the early years .
these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they explained .
the second def@@ end@@ ant was also indic@@ ted .
all the movements are in cash , and he said in his statement that he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his hom@@ etown to the bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard provides another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the computer can disman@@ tle other jobs during the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions at the US computer terri@@ es@@ Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this will save costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , and the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the disman@@ tling of 5@@ 5.000 jobs in the past three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP still had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the other hand , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share delivered 2.3 percent .
the large @-@ scale company from Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , the revenues declined in 15 from 16 quarters .
with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions , HP respon@@ ds to the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets than traditional computers and do more and more businesses online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan envis@@ ages the disman@@ tling of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct involvement of German soldiers in hos@@ tilities in Iraq would , however , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly re@@ pu@@ di@@ ate : 54 per cent voted against it , 35 per cent voted in favour .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria will find 61 percent positive .
however , 24 percent oppose the conflict .
together with Syrian rulers , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed reject 20 percent of the respon@@ dents .
29 percent were not able to decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
until the 27th of September , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electric mobility will be at the centre of the trade fair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday to Saturday .
the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA Auto @-@ Verband reck@@ on as two years ago with approximately 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence on the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ sheds against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ light was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles by officials .
the officials initially used to stop pep@@ per@@ stone un@@ interrup@@ t@@ edly .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now res@@ or@@ ted somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make an important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists , questioned by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and that interest rates on the current level will hold 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a major central bank could potentially leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8.@@ 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death cont@@ actor at Delta State University leaving ap@@ ologies
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could und@@ o it , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he had shot at a man , and he killed a man .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb asc@@ ended 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen chan@@ ted him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb sent relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up at Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb went to the side , fled to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , just like his c@@ law on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug traffi@@ cking .
all this surely demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone .
150 of the approximately 1000 senior executives around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , the Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business in future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the Pilot Federation cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations after the court stopped strike are to be resum@@ ed on Thursday .
this shared the union with them .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit wanted to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it fores@@ ees that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors places distances on the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external defence to weeping and excluding him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al hopes that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very heavy and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double group , then it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during defeat at PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ coach , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a burst of leg when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball which was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ ou@@ ting by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to leave Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to be a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , rel@@ inqu@@ ishes a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; one reads .
as if that would not be suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ rift @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , Cameron is unlikely to be so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the cov@@ eted , trees prone , Th@@ rift kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , who speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s elec@@ torate &apos;s office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England Test K@@ ader and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th was extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss commen@@ ded his attitude , even if he did not produce such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance to play home and abroad .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a whi@@ p I fall high .
he is an X @-@ Factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would give an extra spin punch and receive four squ@@ e@@ aks appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and he has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might have not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred of us right away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s an Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .

David Cameron &apos;s un@@ ex@@ hor@@ red ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper with every day , even without the election of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU now is and not always of their own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with spl@@ its conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract changes , which they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if they thre@@ aten social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a picture of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants an outside UK in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long exp@@ atri@@ ates like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Press F@@ oun@@ tain , as it did during the 1975 referendum , which was inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can &apos;t remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
in addition , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als belonged to most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought of her , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which then was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his door to him .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s years , an error at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;m kind of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friendly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ ance tendency and the wild fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism might say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs in him fought , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father insist@@ ed on television to be il@@ lo@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor did J@@ C tell his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he has even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep label support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ington Belgian economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discourse under the left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I remembered at the start on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum referred to .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and described it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month interven@@ ed on the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alleg@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the meeting of the P@@ he tobacco line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ is@@ cate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tough evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions in the P@@ he report will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to the tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio cost should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard controversial tim@@ ers against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not think medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least install its production on programs that others do not do or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is , of course , non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax funded programs could be funded even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I want to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows give back what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ ine lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows were supposed to sell like East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify $ 4 billion in broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call on you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that we all think you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if that is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their eth@@ ic mission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and enter@@ tain &quot; the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances enter to make it available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by explo@@ sions of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by turning on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that causes electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground breaking tool that enables scientists to turn neur@@ ons with impulses of light on and off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the cited human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
many artists join activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside to the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - by a blank of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger by the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are looking for fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to che@@ at : people tell where you come from , where you come from , where you stand in terms of cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly tell Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes are burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , movie night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear themselves and wear their under@@ wear .
related : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ ble culture , which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of lo@@ af@@ ing : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked them something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added her milk to a dish@@ washing agent to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the verb .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if it was something for them to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with still loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went on to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for her future marriage partner , go to her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she treats all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en to a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .

terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single persons , low income
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in small Fran@@ con@@ ian corner houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single mother and the poor ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how to build affordable and well @-@ build today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will press on the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds up town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part of it here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square metres of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have completed my project correctly .
it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , also ordinary people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and inexpensive building even today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to handle the problem , users are advised to either wait for the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean er@@ asing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able through the tim@@ ber@@ ing of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth making sure that your cell phone is charged while updating or is close to a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch off half way and this might result in a demoli@@ tion of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has included another member in his ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it of the 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which pres@@ ided over Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new focal point at Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses .
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , elderly and coun@@ sell@@ ors receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of the health and nursing branch .
for years , with our out@@ patient nursing service , we have established that often @-@ caring members are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many services of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner of the household , J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office as well as for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out@@ patient service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic shift .
because this requires a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
moreover , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined with the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able gather@@ ings . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar surroundings as soon as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

we therefore hope for many spectators , and this is not without reason , because floo@@ d@@ light plays have a special appeal .
in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC In@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg started in 2010 with victories in the district li@@ gi@@ sts 1st FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Regi@@ on@@ alli@@ gi@@ sts 1st FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .

ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese is ung@@ u@@ ar@@ ded in Bremen .
the foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , Ex @-@ Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have acquired 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years .
intellec@@ tually , on the other hand , he has not admitted .
gr@@ ass@@ land had just cut off the hair in the inner city of Bremen , when he saw a parking space guar@@ dian issued a criminal record for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , Wiese was stor@@ ming from the shop , insul@@ ted the bureau@@ cra@@ t and threw the fake money penalty from the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
with the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow will be displayed or not .

men att@@ est to 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses search for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men shou@@ ted to the young boy and struck it with his fist on his face .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ break and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a car up to their apartment and drove past demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs were checked with the help of a stro@@ king .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue description of the perpet@@ r@@ ator is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and noti@@ fiers to sign up at the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor , mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs may@@ ors Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller commen@@ ces the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the fel@@ lows of years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gs@@ l , who currently completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and wants to get into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of pursuing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz circle and volunte@@ ered in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness for frac@@ ture @-@ dwelling Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 euros is granted by the rub@@ b@@ ish in the framework of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and joyful we are , that practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , some 2,000 patients come to practice ri@@ ms each quarter , while in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel .
if no success@@ ors were found , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s office hour , inci@@ dentally also still looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness already felt her after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also going up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum must also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people is of par@@ amount importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor the Austr@@ o @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia declined
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also let the refugees arrive in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is the way the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see in Lai@@ bach though .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slov@@ ene does not want to aboli@@ sh its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees constantly arrive in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross have already been in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , there were buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , refer@@ ing Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning and further buses were expected in the course of the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria
the occup@@ ants were on the way all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away , through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary had admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat far@@ ther west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had stressed that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees according to plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently demonstrated a good testimony to the country , regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings from Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early on a local evi@@ den@@ ces in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not currently deal with very high number of refugees .
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn in Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminals accused of providing insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ meister and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , in@@ sider trading should have been done on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are supposed to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their err@@ ands , partly quick steps , partly comfortably stroll .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Car seat at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
urban railways maintain .
vibrant , bu@@ stling life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die .... &quot;
with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively drew attention to their 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as to questions and conversations like the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ mati@@ vely adds to my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not long suffering &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again , small discussions develop on the ver@@ ge of the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that for me the end comes to this world some@@ time , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ itas Association is the sponsor of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective operation is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to opening up people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant scor@@ ed its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its cargo transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this point last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces Ear@@ nings between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 C@@ ents less than previous forecast .
analysts eag@@ erly anticipated a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect is , in spite of the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January , and despite increased sur@@ charges for heavy cargo transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which were predicted by the twelve analysts who were inter@@ viewed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analy@@ st surv@@ eyed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation , bringing sales to stagn@@ ate in its Un@@ ity Express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 .
on its most awa@@ ited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the interest rate for almost a decade .
threatening above them at one end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey meeting hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ Factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented stimulus by the near @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows well , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets might frigh@@ ten the already pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only by one @-@ quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself prohi@@ bits the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage increased by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would paci@@ fy the financial markets , because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world met at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rate fell by over 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when interest should be increased .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in terms of technical decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the last few years .
the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also provide advice to other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , apparently not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest raising , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives had revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market launch , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England &apos;s Bank of Inter@@ est Rates .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I do not believe it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often called Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which also sells to the general public .
yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .

the shop is huge and it takes about an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
if the entire shopping experience makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the bar ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the coff@@ ers and has several sampling options .

even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany for these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 L@@ enzen , she still teaches .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to inform women shock@@ ing how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds move forward step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated building proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before that , the Board decided , among other things , an application for a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gab@@ led roof with a non @-@ con@@ ju@@ gal first and roof super@@ structure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is intended to use the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , it was about the roof inclin@@ ation , which , for reasons of energy , is to be less than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof inclin@@ ation does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - although the Bern@@ ard@@ ine Municipal Council usually leaves more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating motions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the case of turn@@ hall construction , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated on costs .
grants are expected from school and broad@@ side transport .
in the next process step , the building instruction for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be submitted to the District Office for Ex@@ am@@ ination .
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg clinic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the district council of the district coun@@ cill@@ or , who confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing Internal Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner white , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who declared himself ready to take over the leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team are to leave both houses to the Supervisory Board , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will hen@@ ce@@ forth be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner white could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years , has not existed .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) was again and again threatened by closure in the past few decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police informed .
after a shot , a man of 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the det@@ ective police were determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who are missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to kill the young and cast their dead bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a crime of violence since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police announced on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old also captured on Tuesday evening is considered to be very suspi@@ cious , who did indeed indicate the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators initially strug@@ gled for personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities admitted to the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday . the investig@@ ators lay dead on him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on the closer circumstances of the act should bring the further investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing space
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable residence .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with income @-@ driven citizens around the last affordable apartments .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an accommodation .
many then hit the flat @-@ floor and set up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also has considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of the past few years .
Germany is shooting a flat deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 housing units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ained to Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason many professionals were living in big cities in a not@@ e@@ worthy way in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the Finn@@ s on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives are to revi@@ ve social housing construction .
thus , the value added tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Cl@@ an .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee accommodation in the Kf@@ W state bank is already well underway in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , with 184 million euros , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros were already available on Monday evening .
now the project could be even increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia judge a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no passing through to Hungary , as more and more refugees vote on the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the disman@@ tling of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrived in Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RT@@ L reports .
on the eve of the day Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force the same day , moreover , make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; min@@ e@@ clearance must now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary , however , barely more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 affected people .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws thre@@ aten the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there .
practically no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported .
only a few hundred refugees were gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left the road in the past few weeks .
barrier gri@@ lles were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still held in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg around 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot in Frei@@ las@@ sing .
mayor went &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set up rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was at the end of W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first un@@ veiled the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in an O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , in order to do it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
however , the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent tens of thousands to us now is a logical result of hypo@@ critical policies :
instead of helping in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity , our German chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly and publicly moved the Hungarian government &apos;s position into the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees must also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they have invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for people seeking refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ proof Quar@@ ters
with the provision of refugees , Konrad himself has to do all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the start @-@ up centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great vor@@ tices , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad deals with a demand of 8@@ 5.000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ful year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the tri@@ but@@ aries .
they would have assured him to even create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s going well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of need , it cannot be that lod@@ g@@ ings must comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a fixed time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be valid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad with his experience is based on the fact that he is more successful in contrast to the ministry of the Interior in the accommodation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman who does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz is calling for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , however , other sites should be tested for their suitability .
the Mayor critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the Federal State .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has taken on a further course in the refugee issue on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once more called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger the fact that Austria now also carries out controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later acquiring them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
€ 1.7 million have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on ven@@ eer hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now acquired an increase in the form of a further business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop , opposite the shop , selling bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are worth 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
several weeks ago it was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz Europe that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most apt when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ tures when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert cannot answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a nice bag enhances any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this property also links many with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself hostile , journalists are concerned or reveals gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office spark@@ s vigor@@ ously the election campaign .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ eh@@ hair@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the village of Win@@ zer@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabitants area are related to it over ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary on the place and his famous young@@ sters , including Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , called &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate company were the first purchases of land in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz was at that time .
he did not take Tr@@ ump , because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Eth@@ ics , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this is in contrast to the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter the illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born trumpet , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more distant to the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so four thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension @-@ host@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz ended in a visit something for the church organ , which generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 children , also in the US the interest is awak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hands of Vice President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Austrian Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominated the reviews , despite attempts at N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been any major changes in the Today &apos;s Reviews .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Gy@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV broad@@ casts including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sunrise reached an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capital cities compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
in August , Today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up until now , sunrise at 34@@ ,000 spectators at an average of 34@@ ,000 fans will be at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics have wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 44@@ 6.000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour it was a total of 7@@ 20,000 .
hot water average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 PM .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars per minute who didn &apos;t manage to beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may have accidentally added an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed to the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood were well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pre@@ ten@@ ding to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not her , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday at 7 : 30 a.@@ m .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a boom as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return and also to the ongoing game following an infrin@@ gement of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ts@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

because of the high number of refugees , the Free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the fall of the F@@ W in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get turbul@@ ence in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre @-@ Free Pre @-@ Party Land parliament conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
in fact , all other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Cho@@ col@@ ate Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Cho@@ elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative tri@@ bun@@ als responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need national standards of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Landes@@ politik in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long standing trial is on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Culture Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Medium Stage plus &quot; at 47 high schools , with an extension of the secondary school from three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax jumps on the jumps
the German stock market has closed off trend @-@ free and nervous trade history with profits over a long distance .
only in the afternoon was a firm pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which finally promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value was 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ D@@ ax increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 , as the Euro zone &apos;s body index , fell by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also shed light on trading posts in London and Paris .
in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index has recently noted around 1 percent in the increase .
many stock exchanges expect the markets to appear on this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the large decline on the fut@@ ures exchanges .
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has de@@ pressed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and left deep marks at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.3 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax tip .
according to a retail@@ er , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend .
so investors gave too little attention to the German chip maker .
investments in promising wafer technology and focus should be paid to the car market .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were again sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the AC@@ EA industry association announced at the start of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt .
Daimler and BMW securities increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the pension index Rex rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Federal Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the Euro sank in the afternoon to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
by mid@@ day the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) U.S. dollars .

4 People killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets against a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal was saying that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ras@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been ruled over for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but legis@@ lators have accelerated the trial after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
building site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be repaired again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4,000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor may be challenged is not yet clear .
according to this , no contracts were concluded either .
the city Em@@ den had purchased a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Avenue , already purchased several months ago and the building on it can be torn off .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sell@@ out of their leisure activities
for months it was negotiated behind closed doors , covered , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized em@@ blem of the company &quot; System Bau , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger proce@@ eded from the system @-@ construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors right now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ p that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics , that the traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be full bus loads to expect that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hectare site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were even more variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to raise € 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees rolled over the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
instead of leaving a manager for the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , had fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / was to be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diab@@ e@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in humans who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have collected data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach scar@@ ring - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus dis@@ b@@ anded completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes fully dissolved only at one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the blood pressure controls , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the patient blood level of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , it remained stable at about 8 percent in the medical therapy group .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ ies group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater return in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was with obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly joined their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a theme that is currently paying more attention to fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ attractive at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is less@@ ened in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and found out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resol@@ ving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 that swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reporting the po@@ ison@@ ous control centres , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
YouTube videos show how young@@ sters drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have pur@@ port@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
young children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can cause alcohol intoxic@@ ation especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control centre in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry to the hand@@ shake disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor treated at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lam@@ ented her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had met her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths were associated with alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario deposited women after swal@@ lowing hands @-@ free disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the New York State were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand@@ ler disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the insul@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and had disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
at a rear @-@ end collision at the cross@@ bar between Nordr@@ ing and Up@@ gra@@ ding , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
at the cross@@ bar , a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about industrial area and realized it was too late that two driving cars had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audience and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
at the accident @-@ involved vehicles there was a damage of about 10,000 euros , the police had to communicate with .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer prepared and had to be tow@@ ed .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers aren &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars di@@ kes .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed , which now stands clearly at the top of the table with a five point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ à said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious in January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , pointing out that he ha@@ st@@ ened a few January @-@ transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ces and insist@@ ed that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ det .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to incorporate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target person Mich@@ u with return notice
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires with the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a ring@@ ed kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts Set on S@@ FA Battle for N@@ eil@@ sons &apos; comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was cancelled later - the third ray of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on any achievement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the impro@@ b@@ able bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; the whi@@ rl@@ wind said , &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline in the field must end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ happy to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ tions to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker or le@@ agues , which games of this kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises overall in the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost a year ago that Scotland decided to remain part of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drunk disturbing the process
as the security staff was unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .

why I am witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later today , except for a late legal action , I will see a man being put to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she acknowledged that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have form@@ ulate it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he &apos;d do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ commodity , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying unnecessary death .
man after moist police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he talked to the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a house peace break@@ out incident in Becken@@ ried .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior officer S@@ hand@@ elle Cast@@ le@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior officer Cast@@ le@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable sample .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ in @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt test sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to w@@ ander about my head and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m doing my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ et@@ ing.com that the integrity department tried to spy out his stall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L act cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Train@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fru@@ stration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; levels have been built up with a long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license above the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which b@@ umped against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been this night .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it had it on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting back
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called cri@@ tique of the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the ump@@ ires have allowed the storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed re@@ mark to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack of his team and said they were only focused on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team gave him a confident voice , as it meant they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that has brought us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this time and again this time of the year appears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these types of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm prevailed against R@@ oo@@ sters as the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points anything exciting ?
for me , there are the game boards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong penalty because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota response .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ad@@ mits his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Ser@@ b passport , reports to the police daily and is holding an exit block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
A5 auto@@ crash at Karlsruhe : guide &apos;s house spl@@ its apart
during a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing plan demoli@@ shed completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 am .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg picked up the girl &apos;s phone when he was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were performed by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty , in the sense of the indictment , to have in@@ decent images taken by children on 14 June of last year , to have viol@@ ated the runs on 25 January of this year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg was not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a ref@@ und@@ able deposit but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings in other cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
floo@@ d@@ sight switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the administrative districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn along the border river Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and reser@@ vo@@ irs .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police , the Munich Central Station saw clearly more refugees compared to the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 am , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : the prec@@ ursor of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest is expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area above Western Europe , warm sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the strong deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic over the past few days from the Bermuda Islands .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday soon also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ award with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is mainly due to movement in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : approximately 28@@ ,@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted asylum to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the judicial body of Te@@ gel , who had been living in a small cell for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates basically claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were locked away only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s information , was now back on his free foot , was reloc@@ ated to a larger cell .
his administrative liability for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed though .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and returned the case back to the re@@ trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity inf@@ ring@@ ed .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of cash compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not speak to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was locked in a prison naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , human dignity is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also affir@@ med the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had granted an in@@ decent housing to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
for more than three months , the plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have been hit the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to massac@@ res it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 dwell@@ ings ) .
however , the lack of housing , above all for affordable rental properties , is dramatic : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister for Building Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is much too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing every year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest amounting to 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically requ@@ esting their qualifications to help them get started , but Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the este@@ em in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ u@@ ber , there has been a political shift : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view point is that refugees should be facilit@@ ated faster access to the labour market .
lack of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration noticed that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ dow@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Federal State prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugee can be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ ce do not receive any benefits after the asylum application law more if they start a study .
in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to vote .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span was shortened to 15 months .
however , this gap has to be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g at once .
Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively move into Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control opportunities .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to avoid such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed that the rac@@ ist motif in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention are committed to Germany must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , says Dr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system for this purpose .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is asking to hand out health cards to all the newcom@@ ers alike .
services rendered could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to pick up so many people with the limited scope of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors in particular make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants become less informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , she demands .
many refugees would also have helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated obstruc@@ tions among refugee children , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ raising .
but with some of the other symptoms , German doctors come from their training , but it &apos;s clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have had a highly developed education system , some of them even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most people suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable .
a recent study by TU München confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers , among other things , so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill seek@@ ers can put an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the aim is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e gen@@ esis .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for enthusiasts is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of Circus offers talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family casts a spell over the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record it .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is aimed at capturing women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a sense of touch and artic@@ ulation .
balance with the wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
dar@@ ing people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic among various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if we don &apos;t do well with our animals , we are not going well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read from the eyes as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the top priority is : good for the animals .
especially on its zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
it is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe Pres@@ ents Fal@@ se Spe@@ ech in the Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ens .
last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the democratic change movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them of interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament is termin@@ ated , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard stores up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities .
the expected reduction in job cuts will result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University , Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused businesses perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain at the European Championship .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the early season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; he said .
it is a bone not healing well .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowled@@ ges , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played 157 lig@@ asp@@ es in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have suffered most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow the players who need to give a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European Cup victory with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said .
it has never worked out in ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves now has become more desperate than ever before , like suicide among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ xes ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of over 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you only have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style through substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to be strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared that money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments playing football in cozy arm@@ chairs and Ross &apos; longing for Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone care it explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ lasting cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Rodri@@ gu@@ id@@ i after his hits on Malm@@ ö .
di Maria hits the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to pass PS@@ G to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ pu@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they do not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ down rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or backwards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was pi@@ er@@ ced in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö Defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the nest .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ passes and bad connections , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half in no less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he demonstrated a lot more skill in bringing his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a spin which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth consecutive season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a lef@@ tist flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended up all the thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game from them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the local mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by falling commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday at a stock sale as part of its huge scheme of debt .
the Gl@@ en@@ core company registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately € 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange trading on early Wednesday morning .
the share sprang up 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the broader plans to blo@@ t around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the shares .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
just a few years ago FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champi@@ ons , four times champion league winners , two times club champion , two times champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already in Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted me to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we have nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rum ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ di@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i ?
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it in the cast of the film and not with the instrumentation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian prevailed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - who will always be the director - how they treat the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te beaten by her white hat@@ ch .
the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded without dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et has served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement came across the country and pushed law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the inclusion of color .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent matter &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and control aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which closed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought win , still under the shock of winning the big prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had it for life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed , with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter , sat down to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s h@@ itting some anger about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had revers@@ ed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins turned a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to hold over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tiger manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ at each game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ piece hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the logs well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ lion , and he put it directly into the game .
with three rounds in the h@@ itting at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped a Two @-@ Run by the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second one brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner city , Detroit created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , exp@@ els S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game of an even non @-@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the crime list before the game after he had been missing more than one month due to a back pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z launched Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z accomplished his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third man , Nick Castell@@ anos , followed a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , made a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter .
he is being examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder strap , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP will das@@ h Daniel Mor@@ ris from the crime list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four star@@ ters with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
they will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they shall then be re@@ distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse according to the pres@@ idency of the government pres@@ elected for the first time .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria one option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective looking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing down on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive stock@@ ing of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Federal Minister , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one was sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees passed over the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee traffi@@ cking in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Angela Merkel announced in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the German Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would get it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided into the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced its intention to tie down the border with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers looking for ev@@ asion on Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of other migrants were making their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this is done by researchers from observations of the spatial son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
thus the moon sw@@ ells easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
this motion may only be small , but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the specialist paper &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the South Pole there must be an underground sea , closed astronom@@ ers back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
around a month , the 1860 Munich must ren@@ ounce offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old informed the association .
at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain .
according to Munich @-@ based Lion the diagnosis is expected to be &quot; four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director , Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible obligation of a non @-@ profit professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
yet , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them , B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C contain vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ go can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hear@@ ty dishes .
it moder@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ tea and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ cha@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS ensures up to 9@@ 5,000 assistance for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , announced UPS on Tuesday .
first and foremost , drivers are sought .
already last year , UPS had extended its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 assistance .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , F@@ ed@@ Ex and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service .
first fo@@ eh@@ n@@ ado , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the alpine side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partially with storm @-@ strength through the river valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west current .
on the mountain@@ side @-@ side breaks in the night to Wednesday the F@@ öhn through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows into the fo@@ eh@@ ouses with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ i country partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ow at the alpine rock slope .
here rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected , this after large quantities of rain have already fallen over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow takes off the air , as a result , a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain comes from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind continues to fres@@ hen up to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures clearly return .
the following days are coming autumn autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on Wednesday at the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place will become visible that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten b@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions should have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then started the division of the Western Church with his thesis against the ab@@ las@@ tic trade .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles focusing on topics like cross roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he has immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into present @-@ day contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewel has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Gl@@ ory of Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to bring myself back with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to be more important to art in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have another pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old did not pay attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but the topics that are important to him are also chosen .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; arose a picture Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther publishing house this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas models - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail seam
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round trip : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official inauguration of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X ) was finished .
failures in politics and administration were responsible for the failure , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hi@@ ked up hill , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will go down in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is posting a clear signal on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politicians to help tackle the problems arising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach , head of DF@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the federal states also support this programme .
already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports@@ man Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody is allowed to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football fans , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German soccer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs would have started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will each provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses one eye in case of accident
the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , impot@@ ent and then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mis@@ h ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally crushed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot draw on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the BV@@ B coach answered whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change in the position of the go@@ al@@ keeper .
for this reason Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master @-@ keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tu@@ ch@@ el left open if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes into action in all Europa League matches in the future .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement from fellow player Re@@ us that the final suit for BV@@ B must be the goal in the Europa League , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l believes : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead Germany
according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the home of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt International Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives of industry at the International Motor Show .
among other things , the Transport Ministry &apos;s strategy paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio .
for the testing of new technology there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around the world to increase the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as drivers .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving can be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected far from 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respon@@ dents with autonomous driving cars in the USA account for 33 percent .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 percent of the traffic could be envis@@ aged on the motorway , and 45 per cent in traffic jams .
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances control .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based programme will only open in sing@@ les from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision shall be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys got to know it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship event in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German Master is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side is , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ ky in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo had also been missing , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United suffered a serious injury to the right leg .
at the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kl@@ ing of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax cra@@ ck@@ le cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the cli@@ ma@@ xes : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , has become the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ached in the past , but in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was spent : in order to modernis@@ e the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot made 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , timi@@ d fashion attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his t@@ ed@@ dy bear and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - lace as fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in a large quantity for customers who worked on them for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
that alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , represents an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
Mo@@ vable P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty shops and wholesale shops are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost exclusively distributed over chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date with Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the embroi@@ dery bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
a graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball tip .
the machine ch@@ okes small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the head of snow for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new spin @-@ offs and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group adopted a number of directives , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the citizens reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and businesses that are not into question for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legally binding business environment and making the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier .
the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission plans to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thereby increase the consumption of a significantly higher dose of the pesti@@ cide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force for pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve tip for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches must not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch aims to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller grav@@ ey@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decrease in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates strongly over the food chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small volumes can cause serious damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly transported to the environment by burning coal .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants put more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total population em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide sur@@ passed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
