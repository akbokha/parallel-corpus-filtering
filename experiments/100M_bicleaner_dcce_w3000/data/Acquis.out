&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of part I as necessary .
the purpose of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a bran@@ ching by the risk of early detection .
to obtain the objective specified in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organization is made by an explanation in which the quantity of material that is not proven for a period of time under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified length is specified for each material balance zone .
in carrying out their audit , the organization makes use of the security system of the Community in accordance with article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material community in accordance with this agreement is based on a structure in material light zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the Community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following nature and , as far as necessary , see how they are determined and useful in supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and not measured losses ;
( F ) a Protocol - and reporting system that indicates the core material level and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Method to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this Convention are not based on material in mining or ore processing .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the organization of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other core material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the States , it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The coll@@ ateral provided in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . however , if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not met , however , the Community considers that the appropri@@ ation of nuclear material , the security measures in accordance with this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable preventive measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this agreement :
a ) Partic@@ ular fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the Organization liber@@ ates nuclear material , which otherwise would be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , from these coll@@ ateral measures , provided that the total material quantity delivered to this Article in the states is at no point at no point at all .
a ) a total of one kilogram of special folding material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the supplied core material is to be processed or stored together with nuclear material , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the safety measures are taken on that material .
the Community meets with the Organisation supplementary agreements which are necessary to determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable to the extent that is required for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the Organization in accordance with this Convention .
the suppl@@ em@@ enting agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all the efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial survey mentioned in Article 62 , the Organization shall set up a combined inventory of the entire core material submitted to this Convention in the States regardless of its origin , and continue to carry out this inventory based on the following reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other .
the EM@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sources of interference .
C ) It is the target of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the Organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Trade Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the Special Trade account . this account is managed by the organization as a ste@@ ward and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the transaction is separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or un@@ solic@@ ited debit notes of the member state , which are payable on request in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the transaction accounts and to be deposited at the institution of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee shall be made within 30 days from the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may request payments in advance of the aforementioned dead@@ lines .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional pus@@ hes on the cash or the school j@@ ails in order to cover expenses for the transaction loan and to equ@@ alize the transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional loan holding capacity to loan agreements without dis@@ grace ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices which are considered to be considered by the organisation &apos;s ordinary means of development , approved , approved and managed , with which the objective of the acknowled@@ gement referred to under letter b ) is to be taken into account .
the funds of the transaction accounts may not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or a project which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the Organization on the day of entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in the past ten years in a period of 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of these bi@@ ds are to be paid directly to the organization which it reserves .
each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is given .
the income from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which the administrator has set at the time of loan granted , may be bene@@ fici@@ ary of a transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account , and the amount rep@@ aid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back to the Member State , as soon as possible , by the administrator .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors until the full assignment of all the transaction loans to the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the payment of the transaction loans , the administrator has informed the EEC once a quarter of a year on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organization , a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
following the full payment of the transaction loans , the Managing Director of the EEC shall report a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the transaction account , the amounts paid out of the accounts and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent .
the EEC and the Administrator work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of the special transaction accounts from time to time an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed through special transactions and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization may agree , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be due to immediate effect .
if the total amount of capital of all the bene@@ fici@@ ary loans made by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat General of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the procedures concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the regular approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each word being equally authentic .
whereas the agreement should be concluded in the form of a correspondence concerning the amend@@ ment of Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T has adopted :

I honor you confirm the agreement of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s approval to the previous one .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s approval to the previous one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States in the medium term financial state
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future Delivery Units of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by credit , BI@@ S initially would assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renewal without being exceeded a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as the extension of the extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing dies should not be made before the exp@@ iry of one month after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the means of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who applied the BI@@ S at the respective time to transactions conducted under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S needs to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the resulting interest rate could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin raised by the corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I agree to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this writing .

if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult this agreement before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under the number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community is entitled to the protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the provision regulated by this agreement will not be affected by the provision of a provision for the community market .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ ism of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount set under # 2 according to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import regulations for these new Member States shall be ens@@ hr@@ ined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is due to the number 5 mentioned ho@@ ech@@ ism of exhaus@@ tion .
the total quantity called number 2 is set to 5 800 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the accession of Greece to the Community .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or appari@@ tions may not appear : a ) here@@ tical properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent being examined for double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated only for the volume of the blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International norms , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being worked out .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as non @-@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard preparation or a state @-@ of @-@ state preparation in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , so contain the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the final satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which it has been dried and which is closed in such a way that no moisture can enter .
a dry agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ us oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authority of the state can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents shipped with the dry re@@ agents ) is added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ um .
the re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after the re@@ activation , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for international exchange for blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents provided have to be kept from the laboratory for a long time until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers should contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
each con@@ sign@@ ment shall be accompanied by a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the Annex to this Protocol .
