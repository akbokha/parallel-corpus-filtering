<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other.</seg>
<seg id="730">The EMG has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by general ressources of interference.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the target of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the Organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Trade Account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the Special Trade account. this account is managed by the organization as a steward and used (in this property the organization is referred to as "administrator"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The transaction is separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or unsolicited debit notes of the member state, which are payable on request in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the transaction accounts and to be deposited at the institution of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two instalments, and i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee shall be made within 30 days from the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator;</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may request payments in advance of the aforementioned deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional pushes on the cash or the school jails in order to cover expenses for the transaction loan and to equalize the transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of this loan, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional loan holding capacity to loan agreements without disgrace; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), regardless of whether it is part of the organisation's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices which are considered to be considered by the organisation's ordinary means of development, approved, approved and managed, with which the objective of the acknowledgement referred to under letter b) is to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the transaction accounts may not be used instead of the Bank's Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or a project which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the Organization on the day of entry into force.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of these bids are to be paid directly to the organization which it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in particular the origin of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services produced (i) in a member state; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which the administrator has set at the time of loan granted, may be beneficiary of a transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account, and the amount repaid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back to the Member State, as soon as possible, by the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors until the full assignment of all the transaction loans to the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payment of the transaction loans, the administrator has informed the EEC once a quarter of a year on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organization, a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">Following the full payment of the transaction loans, the Managing Director of the EEC shall report a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
