this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please refer to the packaging instructions ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. kn@@ it thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , suspicion and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anom@@ al@@ ous high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to take in or the melting tablets in patients that difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial agent &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a smaller degree than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffer from increased distur@@ b@@ ance over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the changes in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to study how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and absor@@ bs the solution to intake ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , di@@ sti@@ pation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the marketing of abili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in view of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including abili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution must be taken when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reduc@@ tions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zers .
considering the joint offering of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate rise in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ morph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this medicine may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data @-@ situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies of animals unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ma@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with AIDS therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under aria treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients treated with hal@@ otherapy treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from aria treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
there were no medi@@ cally significant differences between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were identified .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their appearance also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l have been observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , it is unlikely that Hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma scrap bond .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance via the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the cycl@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ operated @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents in response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current measurement scales , defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ say depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the reg@@ ression rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an om@@ is@@ ap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significant fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l showed superi@@ ority compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms more than 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l showed a positive effect compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which were partially applied to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superi@@ ority over the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a recur@@ r@@ ence in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xi@@ fication of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ xing is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean postoperative period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equ@@ ates to 3 @-@ 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
furthermore , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solution .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that lead to positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold of middle @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

in an om@@ is@@ ap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significant fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as a solution to the intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ tig@@ m@@ atism and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by b@@ yp@@ assing obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy Tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution in patients with a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to the cum@@ ulative application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers were used as an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular dose and the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) was in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zers , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .

107 U@@ sed side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials treated or@@ ally ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from aria treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from aria treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from aria @-@ treated patients was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
there were no medi@@ cally significant differences between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were identified .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their appearance also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as as@@ tig@@ m@@ atism and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms concerning the ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe toxic@@ ity , a similar effect was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ operated @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents in response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current measurement scales , defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the reg@@ ression rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an om@@ is@@ ap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
111 in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superi@@ ority over the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a recur@@ r@@ ence in the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular in 15 and 5 times over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application showed no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety di@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equ@@ ates to 3 @-@ 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer who had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine of about three quarters earlier .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with that of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
it must also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs and that it does not have to be given to other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ x@@ ane Bio@@ Science Limited approval for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ert@@ ness &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or a severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired kidney function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ enti@@ sts increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the amount of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly defined cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in conjunction with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidence in the indicated patient population is not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ pi@@ ent methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to produce no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised about a sperm con@@ serving before treatment , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most notable ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
side effects listed in Table 1 are listed in conjunction with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally , increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ to@@ de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estim@@ ations of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the rel@@ ocation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ bar and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ sation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in transm@@ its the trans@@ c@@ tose of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ ce @-@ endo@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ating protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ret@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ related un@@ related studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , receiving pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity over pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy following the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cul@@ inary distribution and / or soft band@@ aging of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dosage ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged drug was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available about patients aged over 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market takes care of the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , provided cool@@ ers for transport by the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician whose experience in the treatment of patients with diseases is indicated for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or by not responding adequately to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems compared to the reference medicinal product .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed under the skin had been studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were killed on Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations it was proven that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to the healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued approval for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma that receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volumes ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood Ab@@ se@@ amed may be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in patients with or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia that is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l are increased compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , an approach to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted .
patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , for which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug to the circulation .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a stre@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients who are not eligible for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , es@@ cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of appetite , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the common causes of a non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxidation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes , index ) is decreased ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active ingredients ( ES@@ A ) were given a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ e@@ ins if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the rise in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa administration and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response ( patients that may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) a month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the goal of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients with greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly , if possible prior to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can pose an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events for patients with an initial h@@ um of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins were not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
more than th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ dem@@ ics , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , isch@@ em@@ ic th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ent occur@@ ren@@ ces ( see Section 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which has been isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 64 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ours , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ mal carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , 174 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in .
survival and progression @-@ progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the patient .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed a statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than with the controls because of various common malign@@ an@@ cies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s ser@@ um levels are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um mirrors remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be trac@@ ed back to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies involving approximately 20@@ x of the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished federal body weight , to a delay of the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in red@@ dish mortality .
these reports rely on in vitro diagnostic findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .
within the framework of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a period of maximum 3 days outside the refriger@@ ation case and not over 25 ° C .
the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued label , so if necessary the measurement of partial quantities is possible .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the authorisation has to provide medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail libraries with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts .
the holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market has to make sure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is set up and functional before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the medicine used in traffic is applied .
the holder of the approval for the placing on the market under@@ takes to undertake the trials and additional measures for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance specified in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and to carry out the update of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to each subsequent implementation of the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures could have been met within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction )
• Have a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of a drop in blood in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) - if for example , such a blood @-@ drop occurred earlier .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is reg@@ ained in further treatment .
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests to regularly monitor the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , red blood cell dissolution ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the beginning of the therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how best to treat your an@@ a@@ emia .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may pose the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may take an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically open cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs with inadequate heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of blood arm@@ uth with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for evaluating the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of car@@ p formation ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) .
this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events have already occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in case you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumour .
if a larger orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood lip@@ id ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking / applying other medicines or used / used recently , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory investigations have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia is applied to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this appropriate for appropriate , you can also learn how to in@@ ject Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ li@@ osis , vascular sur@@ ges ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered from a low traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like the eye of the eye ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ reli@@ a can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women the risk of frac@@ ture frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % in patients with ac@@ up@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) over a period of three years .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ reli@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those of plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ reli@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ reli@@ a must not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other component .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ reli@@ a are exposed to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides explan@@ atory material for physicians to prescri@@ be the Ac@@ reli@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ last@@ a in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ tures .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Suppl@@ em@@ ation in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing assistance is to be rec@@ alled
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year to treat post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed solely by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ reli@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently supp@@ ressed low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. orph@@ an or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ reli@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorders ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents ac@@ last@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data on safety and efficacy is missing .
Ac@@ reli@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ c@@ emia is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , breast cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene should be considered with appropriate preventive treatment .
no data is available for patients who need dental surgery , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of acet@@ amin@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ reli@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ reli@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis trials ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured each year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited ren@@ al function in oste@@ opor@@ osis were more than three years comparable between the plac@@ ebo group and the plac@@ ebo group .
temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ reli@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ reli@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently supp@@ ressed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ reli@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area have been reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including ac@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis in the jaw area of a patient treated with Ac@@ reli@@ a and a plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 and at least two light or moderate @-@ heavy current spinal frac@@ tures ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures significantly decreased over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared with plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on frac@@ ture frac@@ tures Ac@@ reli@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ reli@@ a significantly increased bone density at lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ ur han@@ ger by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with Ac@@ reli@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic mud .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ reli@@ a reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ alities were 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ reli@@ a treatment increased compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and lower spine at all points of time .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to plac@@ ebo treatment by 5.4 % at the total th@@ igh and 4.3 % lower than the plac@@ ebo arm .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ reli@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of Ac@@ reli@@ a was not inferior to the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in relation to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moderate @-@ heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ac@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for ac@@ up@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ses at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in the follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the top value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination phase t ½ h 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the 5 to 15 minutes in@@ fusion was reduced by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at the time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of the metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enz@@ ym@@ atic systems is unlikely , because ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not metaboli@@ zed by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the C@@ oli@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adaptation of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
since only limited data is available for severe kidney dys@@ functions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , six times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid was given in rats with doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( an cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site occurred .
the most common infection in repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ ology of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was measured at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low ser@@ um calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

cit@@ ric acid is a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate which is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by normal@@ ising the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
if you use Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently / or have used / used other medicines , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicine that is known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drink , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ reli@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before you end the treatment with Ac@@ reli@@ a Falls you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please make your next appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions , however , are less frequent .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ reli@@ a .
currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .
physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent sor@@ eness and / or incur@@ able wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently supp@@ ressed low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ reli@@ a , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic @-@ running , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ up@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ reli@@ a .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please refer to the packaging instructions ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
compli@@ a is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or • the overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , there were four studies involving more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive means of setting smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on setting the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? s The most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory trac@@ s. n@@ g The complete list of adverse side effects reported in connection with A@@ compli@@ a can be found in the package .
it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can strengthen the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause suicide in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when applying A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , th@@ eli@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or clari@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also exhibit one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compli@@ a is not recommended for children and young people under the age of 18 because of the lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any recognizable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other closest persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately catch up medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) that cannot be adequately set with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ish substance or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin is to be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
this led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered by using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of Ac@@ tos added to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients showing Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( decreased sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos can not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to sp@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is poorly adjusted with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( i.e. early heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark res@@ ins , liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the clinical evaluation of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can ag@@ itate from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with sp@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia is the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported about an occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the incidence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but dec@@ lining doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
frac@@ ture incidence accounted for 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug .
patients should be aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant and if a patient wishes to have pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment should be dismissed ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed from these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents over three times lower the upper limit of the normal range were as common as in plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one respectively .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ isons .
during the trial period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is om@@ itted ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
after two years of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by sp@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cides ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was poorly adjusted with insulin despite three months of optimization were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to have insulin only ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients on 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L cholesterol level and an increase in the HD@@ L cholesterol level and a minor but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol level were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo no statisti@@ cally significant increase of LD@@ L cholesterol was found under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the gl@@ and@@ ular tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both about an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride Ab@@ sorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered sp@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of approximately three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it was possible to prove that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in fa@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination time of imm@@ utable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies coinci@@ ded with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric per@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting from hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous Poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frac@@ ture incidence accounted for 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant in comparison with the bas@@ eline values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the gl@@ and@@ ular tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both via an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride Ab@@ sorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to meet its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ alities , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation of the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ cord has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to a different human@@ oid .
Ac@@ cur@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
it may also be possible to adjust the dos@@ ages of acet@@ one if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list can be found in the package contents ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ cur@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ cord ph@@ ane throughout the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a quick initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adaptation is required when switching to Ac@@ cord , it can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin .
prior to travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account the possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients for any other medicines they have taken .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Ac@@ tually - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy . rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be related to complaints , which are described as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .

skin diseases and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Oc@@ ca@@ sion - li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
general illnesses and ail@@ ments at the administration &apos;s location - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions during the injection site during the insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma at the injection point ) .
disorders of the immune system Ac@@ tually - ur@@ tic@@ aria , ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ euro@@ tic o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should always have dex@@ ter@@ ous pieces , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ousness hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effect lasts up to 24 hours .
absorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ her ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional safety precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ cord has been removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) until it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ed according to the user manual for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human@@ ely ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
it may also be possible to adjust the dos@@ ages of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two kinds of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must be raised , followed by the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adaptation is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
prior to travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and ail@@ ments at the administered location - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions during the injection site during the insulin therapy may occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma at the injection point ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % mortality induced by intraven@@ ous ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total period of work is about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ allo@@ ids , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months there may still be rheum@@ atic attacks ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use aden@@ ur@@ ic treatment at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study in which 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with plac@@ ebo ( apparent drug ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily had 120 mg received a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under the plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in urine deposits ( including one of the current or current g@@ out ties and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid level still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase of 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents as there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous medicines , acute toxic@@ ity may occur during the course of treatment , because of the reduction of the ser@@ um acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobili@@ sed in the tissue .
for example in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
during the phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before beginning the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not conduct drug interactions with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( inhibit@@ ing the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active substance required at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be related to the side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the reported cardiovascular events was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ oid group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) Side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .

the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and is created within the framework of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um cancer ( 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the level of ser@@ um acid on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during a visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um carcin@@ oma of &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x a day .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function limitation ( ie .
the primary efficacy end@@ point with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from phase 3 open in two years showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required a treatment against a feeding .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out node , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the toxic@@ ity up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with fe@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg are proportion@@ ate .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional rise .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ altered f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ c@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times from 7,5 m g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ / ml in the group with heavy whi@@ pping function .
12 Li@@ ver restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- / gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C by F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with about 11 @-@ times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were approximately 3 times higher than the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was observed , accompanied by a reduction in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies on bearing rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not obtain ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the crystal formation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is reached with time .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine , • if you have a heart weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
if you have a stroke at the moment ( sudden occurrence of severe pain , sensitivity to pressure , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , when you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , in order to prevent an attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking / applying other medicines or used / used recently , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicine that contains one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ ur@@ in ( for the reduction of the immune defence ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for th@@ inning of heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on the traffic @-@ ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
therefore , please use AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place in the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D level .
after a 15 week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic bul@@ ging .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be used .
it should not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd . , for the placing on the market of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie down before the first food intake of the day that should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially those were severe and requiring hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be reminded that symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ y , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ astic pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine seek to seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after market introduction ) , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly containing intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether the replacement of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that after having missed a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , they should take the tablet the next morning after having noticed their om@@ is@@ sion .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to treatment .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um calcium levels of up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia and thus to a further increased risk of falls and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia may result in oste@@ opor@@ osis .

after 15 weeks of treatment the average ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / l &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
the therapeutic balance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ centre study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the medium asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur han@@ ger and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients undergoing one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new frac@@ ture frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before starting a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically important change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the average range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats show that , after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily distri@@ butes tissue into soft tissue , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ eces .

characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is to be expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

agra@@ ph is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , with the use of pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were conducted and examined , as amended in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft by the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; reform@@ ulation of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close monitoring of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of agra@@ ph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a tal@@ low , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with a low clearance , an adjustment of the agra@@ ph can take several days before the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral in@@ gest@@ ation of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application In order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be stated .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ oc@@ ab therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further can adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ oc@@ ab therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
after a change of other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants on a daily basis , the treatment with the oral initial dose for the prevention of corneal gra@@ ft rejection must begin with the oral initial dosage recommended in case of ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ t .
heart transplan@@ t In the case of adult patients , which are converted to a agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients though there is no clinical experience with ap@@ agra@@ ph in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , patients with oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day in p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ er@@ splan@@ tation patients were used in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
can adaptation in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood tal@@ king@@ in the target range may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um increments , a calculation of the in@@ in@@ ence and supervision of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ port to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case under the aid of full @-@ blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ kes of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to lawyer , dose adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or while using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as an advisor is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days before the state has entered the state .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ mirrors of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; reform@@ ulation of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close monitoring of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation lawyer .
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording Adv@@ oc@@ ative for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood .
because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with lawyer ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea there is a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ concentration in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which can therefore also occur under agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as advoc@@ ates containing hard capsules , ret@@ inas , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption offers special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction was found with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines , which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which imp@@ air metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposition , it is particularly careful when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments showed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduces the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not possible because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
listed below , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ m@@ able .
impact mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus inhi@@ bits the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 lung transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ as transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f included in these published studies the observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multic@@ enter trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , 2@@ 1,7 % of cases were related to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ al obl@@ iter@@ an compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were killed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ation syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi @-@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , which were random@@ ised to receive Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after transplantation showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bile .
in the case of stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation lawyer .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder due to the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was examined .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ ance in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tics with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG company for the transfer of Adv@@ oc@@ ates throughout the European Union .
the dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II @-@ deficiency , the place and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
for the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma sign ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute depression are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , a proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
in response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differ in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should be determined according to the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk depends on genetic and other factors within the first 20 exposure days .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ory development , following conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low@@ - ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which occurred in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each with 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( often not estimated on the basis of available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained over the whole period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient levels on the 15th of postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients from a clinical trial 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions was reported in the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk balance as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited distributed the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially with the fact that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the insertion of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been changed in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who found Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of documents submitted initially , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on tag 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits the patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the recovery has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and should be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy was the changes in the sever@@ ity of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients reported that the symptoms of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were 4@@ 6.0 % compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ot@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for allergies ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) or ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stro@@ kes ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of aer@@ op@@ lanes throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy , aer@@ os@@ ol should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease with time in case of long @-@ term application .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ sin@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the course of clinical trials with des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether they were alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibited , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate is nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ convenience of the use of aer@@ ob@@ ics during pregnancy is not assured , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ tic , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ ral pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tivity in endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in an adult dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
in view of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences .
as part of an individual dose @-@ dose @-@ study of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four test subjects were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can however not detect any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the Au@@ thor@@ isation Application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to un@@ fold its effect .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and con@@ stric@@ ting or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ lling the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of the con@@ gest@@ ed medicine Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is included in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus ) , a catch of the stomach or the du@@ oden@@ um , a bladder neck catch , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the patient &apos;s history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a cr@@ amp of the lung muscles ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases when using Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and head@@ aches or strengthening existing head@@ aches .
when taking Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
in case of application at the recommended dosage , it is not expected that Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze will lead to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduce the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze , as you should notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten taking Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ pation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes .
cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values , were also very rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children from one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ru@@ ples , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease of the number of symptoms ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % , in comparison to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the number of symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the use of des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms end and can be resum@@ ed after returning .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a prolonged treatment can be recommended for the patient during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness caused by impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common side @-@ effect headache , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ layer trial , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ i@@ or@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
this includes the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of up to 20 mg a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated on behalf of further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of the eti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ amine deficiency is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that , besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of d@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients &apos; patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentration of des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out .
qu@@ or@@ adi@@ n in vivo does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate is nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular dangers for humans .

eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnos@@ ing upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities .
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years are metaboli@@ zed lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems should not use fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ine in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in an additional dose of adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ per@@ ate adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) was administered .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily rec@@ lam@@ ation dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults may be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study for adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ oplas@@ tic dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents had no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to no impairment of the psych@@ om@@ otor system in adults and adolescents in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment nor an increase in sleep@@ iness .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the resulting seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of d@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose trials , AU@@ C and C@@ max values of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ cing bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat can be put into the mouth once a day , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ layer trial where up to 45 mg of Des@@ per@@ ate adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were used .
in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the use of des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the melt tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg used in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile found in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed mel@@ amine as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat contributing to the decreasing formulation of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

after the market launch of A@@ eri@@ us , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulties breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) and rash were reported .
A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is indicated for children between 1 and 11 years , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution to take up an application sy@@ ringe for intake with sc@@ aling is included , you can use this alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution for intake .
regarding treatment duration , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you suffer from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution to intake .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia common side effects were reported in adults ti@@ redness , dry mouth and headache more often than plac@@ ebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with child @-@ safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially approved by the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company will withdraw its application for the transfer of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endo@@ genous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system will later be able to develop antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus of this common ancest@@ or .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a body alien ) was puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are participating in a clinical examination and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the an@@ tivi@@ ral drugs of the patient first , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus is to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the use of low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to use prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks under as@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than in plac@@ ebo , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the generic medicine A@@ gener@@ ase increased viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came to a greater decrease in the viral load after four weeks , together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , compared with the patients who further increased their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
as@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are min@@ ed in the same way as as@@ gener@@ ase and are inj@@ ected in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking as@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis , or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years from the risks associated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of permission for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited to appro@@ ve the marketing of as@@ gener@@ ali@@ ases across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ic ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and patient pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than capsules of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ; hence , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medi@@ oc@@ re liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction can be reduced to 300 mg twice a day .
con@@ current use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r during the ing@@ es@@ tion of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including the Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active ingredient are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are still low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ lim@@ ation of the as@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in certain other patient groups .
if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus have been reported .
many of the patients had other diseases in which medication was required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. Higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ha@@ eti@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids are reported .
at the time of introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate with low therapeutic l@@ atitude must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Sub@@ strate with low therapeu@@ tical l@@ atitude A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with drugs , whose active ingredients are primarily metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in trying to compensate the lower plasma levels caused by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the virus level and if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s Wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , confirming the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice a day in the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but it is recommended that the in@@ comes of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may lower the ser@@ um concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution must be taken because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dosage , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ x compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interactions with as@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines , when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it may cause res@@ or@@ ption disturbances .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ feel pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Isra@@ eli@@ can pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Isra@@ thi@@ pine , may be increased .
con@@ current consumption with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dimin@@ ished by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of generic ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time administration of as@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased simultaneously with the addition of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with an or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while with the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are still low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation how to adjust the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ rus dose if Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
if war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are present together with as@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time administration of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother as compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is passed into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ne@@ sting into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast @-@ feeding of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive ability was not impaired by the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the safety of as@@ gener@@ asis was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment failure .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) occurred under the treatment .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ c sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral individuals who had been treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( pin @-@ jaw ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 performed in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients under Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel treatment with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were similar ; an exception formed increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very frequent .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ hibition ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r lies in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in the case of ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells .
the link between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described above were rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be studied gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance pattern similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ic resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ic resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , with whom a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them pointed out resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hr@@ inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early aband@@ on@@ ment of a preventive therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which adults treated with PI ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies per day ) and nucle@@ o@@ carcin@@ oma ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly acquired with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ failure threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ contaminated rab@@ bits is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children between 2 and 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; most of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell counts of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ali@@ ases should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % elevated , for C@@ max by contrast , reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ connected amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15@@ mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence , as@@ gener@@ ase solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained by healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals appeared in dos@@ ages containing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , little evidence suggests the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in vitro and in vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro @-@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during administration nor after the end of treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in juven@@ iles treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plas@@ ma@@ exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ atic navigation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current application should be performed with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active ingredient are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice a day in the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ feel pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Isra@@ thi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dimin@@ ished by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
if war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are present together with as@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min from amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ne@@ sting into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast @-@ feeding of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period during breast@@ feeding .
the safety of as@@ gener@@ asis was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ hibition ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r lies in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in the case of acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hr@@ inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ ali@@ ases should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
in long @-@ term study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals were observed in dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ o @-@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , little evidence suggests the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in vitro and in vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse Mut@@ ational Test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies in juven@@ iles treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ic ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .

the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than capsules of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ; hence , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake in patients with ren@@ al failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a consequence of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ lim@@ ation , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in case of infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active ingredient are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in the long term if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ha@@ eti@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .

con@@ current consumption with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increases plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is passed into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ne@@ sting into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast @-@ time amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period during breast@@ feeding .
the safety of as@@ gener@@ asis was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described above were rarely observed .
the early aband@@ on@@ ment of a delayed 60 treatment is recommended in order to prevent the accumulation of a multip@@ licity of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ali@@ ases should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it may harm other people , even if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of as@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on your individual viral resistance test and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above conditions or take any of the above drugs .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( booster ) , make sure that you have carefully read the use information of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before beginning the treatment .
likewise , there are no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect of children between 4 and 12 years or in general for patients under 50 kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking as@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before you start taking as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is repeated three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before they are washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo were performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ i ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible con@@ genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment process described above should be considered if intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been missed , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub it in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily occurrence of occur@@ ren@@ ces was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ ish leading to circumcision .
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods applied to the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal area , no clinical experiences have been found so far .
limited data suggest an increased rate of response reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of cow@@ ards .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions result after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data available about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is present in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip .
very limited data are available on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study indicate that patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , we@@ aving or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although the level of ser@@ um ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be reached neither after one time nor after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given for application during breast@@ feeding .
the most frequent contribut@@ ors and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects in studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
patients reported from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the clinical signs indicated by the test plan show that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often occurred to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / fl@@ atten@@ ing ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the assessment of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream was very common ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe shr@@ ink@@ age and scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the un@@ inten@@ tional oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous hydr@@ ation .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was possible to show that efficacy in relation to complete healing of the suitability of the hands during I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior .
60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic inflamm@@ ations within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined follow @-@ up studies indicate a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications for external sei@@ zur@@ es , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose and bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and have therefore not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic exposure of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml for use in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable p@@ ou@@ ch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od by topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial alkal@@ ine cell carcin@@ oma .
doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application also yiel@@ ded similar effects in mice .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at the mal@@ er administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours in the area of application .
the corresponding mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk to the human being due to systemic exposure to be very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase usually form within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a prolonged interval , a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously prec@@ eded due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to qu@@ en@@ ch during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were mostly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3- study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version came within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe sequ@@ ential form usually within one month with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or up to premature ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no as@@ say demonstrated by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ oi@@ esis ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom there was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with mild to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the justification for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the enzyme is the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients had the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an increased exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms each week for another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ mes showed improvement in lung function and ability to be cured in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
in 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was detected , which remained constant to the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients , which was considered clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected per normal fe@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , mainly for the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe lead form and 4 with mean cross @-@ country form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe sequ@@ ential form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle vascular system showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe sequ@@ ential form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed .
in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute salary tests .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ off dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except with those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines containing Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines .
handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oil .
very common ( incidence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ aches • nausea • stomach pain • rash , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Higher pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available every year , and if necessary , the packaging inserts will be updated .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant ) cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , set or the dose is reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ ric acid slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ ric into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ o was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells showed longer survival times when administered by A@@ lim@@ b compared with the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transfer of A@@ lim@@ o across the European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predominantly panel @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predominantly plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the end of the tel@@ emet@@ ric in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is required to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions on the day before and during the day of the tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment as well as on the day after the treatment .
at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken during the seven days prior to the first dose and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period and for another 21 days after the last dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first tel@@ emet@@ ric dosage as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ ric drugs , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the ne@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before the treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , there is an increased risk of side effects compared to patients under the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limitation of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin threshold and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ching and must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ atic number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the amount of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes again ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ tes , the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ at@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had occurred .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the toxic@@ ity of treated patients ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ gi@@ as ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ oric acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a mixed therapy is provided , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with a tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred were associated risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be weigh@@ ed in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in trans@@ lat@@ ular space .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with ph@@ em@@ bo@@ xed occasionally when this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly har@@ dening of the reproductive capacity is made by means of tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed , men should be advised before the treatment instructions to consult with regard to the sperm preservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ gi@@ ants ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can result in increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is required if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and less than 2 days after treatment with tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data on the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with a tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
it must not be applied during pregnancy except if it is obligatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is made possible by means of tel@@ emet@@ ric acid , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether it is possible to skip met@@ ry @-@ mixed into breast milk and unwanted effects on breast@@ fed infants can not be ruled out .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ t and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinical studies with a tel@@ emet@@ ric drug , which is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
clinical trials reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) in patients with refrac@@ tive treatment .
clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure in patients with a tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs have been reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients reported before , during or after their tel@@ emet@@ ric therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ ric xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that tel@@ emet@@ ric acid acts as anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ em@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ tin u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically important advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted from an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy showed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .

limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination across gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adapted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 3@@ 0,@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the impact of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology for survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in accordance with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ failure threshold of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ et trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .

dissolve the content of 500 mg / ml vi@@ als containing 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without any preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml .
the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the product quality .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some of the fats in the food , causing approximately a quarter of the fats supplied with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients with an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stool passage , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , passage o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are taken out of the digestive tract ) or from cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing on the market of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ phi@@ c , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ted , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjusting the dosage .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Premature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption ( see section 4.6 ) • Sti@@ ll time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic is necessary if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional anti @-@ pregnancy measures in order to prevent possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interaction of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the dose of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a slight decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of reported side effects , which were detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days with normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
with the majority of cases reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ id properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is applied in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ isch and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
from clinical trials it was deduc@@ ed that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : changes in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg - 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline : 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg - 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline : 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , given the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ ted dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after sec@@ ession of the N @-@ form yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional toxic@@ ity studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified as a special hazard to humans .

if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in connection with a meal containing too much fat , you risk nutritional accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) .
in order to get used to the new eating habits , start the first capsule intake with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet .
di@@ ets are effective as you can easily understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
in order to achieve your target weight safely , you should define two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• B@@ ate yourself fat to reduce the probability of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • St@@ ay physically active while taking and after taking all@@ i .
• If you are not able to reduce your weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules and result in increased fat being ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the commen@@ cement of treatment , since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you can exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial desktop , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms appear , learn to control over time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date stated on the box . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two sealed container with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them . • You can take your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) attached to this pack .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ aking up with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at a maximum of one day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
see the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Due to the effectiveness of the capsule , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually and continuously lose weight .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ oric intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • En@@ try is a food diary containing information on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you nour@@ ish your calorie and fat reduction and give guidelines to become physically active .
in conjunction with a weight loss program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
al@@ oh@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an antibiotic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years is not recommended because there is not enough information to the effects of this age group .
this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to which recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines are prevented .
in three main studies Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate causes for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
al@@ oh@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy based on cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection should be closely monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- Inter@@ val is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy administration , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron un@@ inhibit@@ edly did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pl@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating doctor .
clinical trials were the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events appeared as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7,@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indicating chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ ple@@ tion and re@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections , a gradual elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days , total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the addition of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination Accor@@ ding to an intraven@@ ous 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
according to a unique intraven@@ ous injection in healthy eyes , the total body size was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance was 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , termin@@ ale elim@@ inations and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only for expos@@ ures considered sufficient over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block i@@ onic can@@ als in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of the action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in the thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans .
the holder of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission of the plans for placing the medicine approved under this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the application of the approval for the placing of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ is should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damages damages and the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally increases .
it is produced by yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been inj@@ ected into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that att@@ est to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed should not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease returned to more patients than with the reference medical drug ; Al@@ ph@@ is also had more side effects .
apart from this , the study used in the study for examining the question of how far the drug acts as an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not vali@@ dated adequately .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ ths ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not affect this type of infection .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients with age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in front @-@ dogs , approximately 90 % of patients from both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stomach @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed by the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ sts , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient in clinical studies of secondary @-@ infected open wounds .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical treatment ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Accor@@ ding to an oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % on the sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not deemed necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are inadequate in regards to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with alt@@ ar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections which Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the location which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially block P @-@ Bin@@ ding @-@ Inter@@ action and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appear question@@ able due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , consultation with experts should be sought .
no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were detected , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ ating and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ ed skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , less involved in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in vivo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus achieving up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sh@@ red@@ ded skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats were found in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ stage vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the im@@ muni@@ zation and it is ensured that the two doses can lead to an end of the existing vacc@@ ination plan .
if a refres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix has the same ingredients as the in@@ oc@@ ulated V@@ acc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved by the Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ ani and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six and a 12 month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 V@@ acc@@ ine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als company .
the standardi@@ zation plan for the immobili@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster vacc@@ ination is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies observed after pri@@ ming with the combination vaccine lie in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured that immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine may need a booster as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ value after pri@@ ming under certain circumstances , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ epi@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ ani was administered in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ tis , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that a sufficient immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was similar to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ricul@@ ation on a basis of calculation per acc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received ambient ampli@@ fication , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ricul@@ ation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vaccine , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B and surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years , the ser@@ um conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ um conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for individuals aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12 - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ ani was administered at the same time with the booster shots of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ tis , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient on all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations and ser@@ um conver@@ sions for the current formulation as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ ation of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus containing food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that might necess@@ itate hosp@@ ital@@ isation .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete trial of 2 cans has been completed .
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B before the two vacc@@ ines are administered ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those in hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may result from it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has already experienced an allergic reaction to a former vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to quickly protect against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an in@@ oc@@ ulation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective constitu@@ ents per acc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective components is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to individuals who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child will undergo a tick analysis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction on the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines ( including those whom you can get without en@@ rol@@ ment ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated against a short time or if you have received / / or have received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ ani is not administered by pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ A very common case ( doses more than 1 case per 10 doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the punc@@ ture point or redness • Mat@@ te@@ ousness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ Frequ@@ ently ( up to 1 case per 10 in@@ oc@@ ulated doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • He@@ aded • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 reported doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or extensive ras@@ hes , which can be it@@ ching or can be ves@@ ic@@ ular , swelling of the eye contours and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since the first approval for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP unanim@@ ously assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix is only marketed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ary can also be used in pre@@ history for patients at the age of over a month with complementary en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
Am@@ mon@@ tane becomes - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose to the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ wealth could not be compared to any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium rap@@ es@@ eed in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ wealth was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information on this medicine was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzymes already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low the tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day must be obtained with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets should not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing as there is a risk for the formation of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a formation .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at takes place over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
under sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal reproduction slow@@ ed down and increased neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of those adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity for intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic compound which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , taken for each gram , can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ aust and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ s within the first year of life .
due to h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative means of nitrogen de@@ position ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first on@@ set of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
the survival rate was 98 % in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ cot@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its can hardly be reversible even during treatment and a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and with repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
according to an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary bladder problems or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) could not be detected in plasma after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma sign were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans had no apparent effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who are not yet able to swal@@ low the tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or through a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , l@@ esi@@ ons occurred in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , taken for each gram , can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its can hardly be reversible even during treatment , and a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate after consuming proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding as the medicine could pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , ob@@ struction of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating the appropriate treatment .

if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose to the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Sub@@ mit a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess pel@@ let . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress lift &quot; ( abnormal measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack help maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another antibody ) and a GP@@ I .
while PCI was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , other medicines were used to prevent blood cl@@ ots like ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the Gift of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding where it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ ob@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and for a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ dus of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is PCI in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
just before the procedure , a bolt load of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ dus of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal products should be carefully mixed before use and the dose of bol@@ us can be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restrictions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second cycle dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients must be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if most bleeding from arter@@ ial points occurs in case of PCI patients suffering from arter@@ ial points of punc@@ ture , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment , in principle , bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with a bi@@ vou@@ ro@@ din , supervision of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be taken into account to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vou@@ ro@@ din is reached the level prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregates ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al parameters are regularly checked .
animal experimental investigations are insufficient in regards to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , we@@ aving or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bic@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to bias inv@@ ader plus GP@@ I / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , adverse events were more common in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ edings like in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding often occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ din / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area requiring radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 4 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed loc@@ alized loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vou@@ chers at 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , adverse events were more common in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with a bi@@ ob@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed in terms of signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ ob@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ onic binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ine .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was unable to indu@@ ce any th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ zi@@ ated th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and conc@@ entri@@ c an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is covered by the prolon@@ gation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI was subsequently performed in the following patients , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ I / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the three treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pep@@ tide forms a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the spl@@ itting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ ine .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or not to process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from the human@@ oid , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of time than a short @-@ acting human@@ oid .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body insulin can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin symptoms .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transfer of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin needs in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of the mode of action , the brand ( producer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc del@@ aying , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can cause a change in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dose or termination of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effect of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment scheme changes .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ irrit@@ ation can be atten@@ u@@ ated or missing under the influence of li@@ mes@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ vo@@ irs .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin induc@@ ing occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk nor is it absorbed by oral use .
listed below are the un@@ desirable pharmac@@ ies known from clinical studies group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is failed to change the injection point within the injection area continuously , can occur subsequently a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be hospit@@ alized in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with a cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus showed insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a dose @-@ proportional draft glucose @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate rise in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves total glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ insul@@ ine .
from the data it was obvious that a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with the normal normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin p@@ li@@ s@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial control than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin pulses are applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved such as the normal normal insulin , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin sensitivity in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to more humane normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin sensitivity in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal mal@@ in@@ ers , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
