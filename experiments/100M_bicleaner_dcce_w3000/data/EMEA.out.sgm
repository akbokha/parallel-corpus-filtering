<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please refer to the packaging instructions (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. knit thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), suspicion and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of anomalous high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased anxiety or behavioural disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to take in or the melting tablets in patients that difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agent" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazl is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a smaller degree than the neurotransmitters, to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripibrazl helps to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffer from increased disturbance over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to that of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the changes in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to study how the body absorbs the melting tablets and absorbs the solution to intake (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), distipation (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressed to the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the marketing of abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In view of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripibozl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripibrazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesired cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripibozole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution must be taken when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripibozole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripiprazl by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolizers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint offering of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate rise in Aripiprazol concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrometmorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This medicine may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data-situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies of animals unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripibrazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazl showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Maisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazl was 15.1% in patients with AIDS therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under aria treatment and 53.3% in patients treated with halotherapy treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from aria treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">There were no medically significant differences between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potential clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters were identified.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibozole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and their appearance also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazl include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdose with Aripiprazl have been observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl, it is unlikely that Hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, as Aripiprazl has a high plasma scrap bond.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripibozl in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance via the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a-receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and the cyclamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operated-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents in response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current measurement scales, defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assay depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher reduction in the regression rate of 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an omisapine-controlled, multinational dual-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', significant fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripibrazl showed superiority compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms more than 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disruption, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and actively controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripibrazl showed a positive effect compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or halidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which were partially applied to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripibozl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed superiority over the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a recurrence in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxification of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyxing is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean postoperative period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazl there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and in a pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety precautionary studies, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">Effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equates to 3-10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solution.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that lead to positions of 3- and 11-fold of middle-steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazl Injection Solution and started using the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by bypassing obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute treatment (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazl is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify Tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazl Injection Solution in patients with astringent and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution is considered necessary, patients should be observed regarding extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">The safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl Injection Solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (either prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the cumulative application of Aripiprazl, in a study in which healthy volunteers were used as an intramuscular dose and the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dose) was intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripibozole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">Compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolizers, CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism can result in common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allsome administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 Used side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials treated orally (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from aria treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from aria treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from aria-treated patients was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">There were no medically significant differences between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potential clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters were identified.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibozole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and their appearance also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazl include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution combined with statistically significant improvements of aggitibility / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as astigmatism and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms concerning the aggregation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe toxicity, a similar effect was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operated-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents in response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current measurement scales, defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the regression rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an omisapine-controlled, multinational dual-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripibozl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl showed superiority over the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a recurrence in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl Injection Solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure (AUC), which was intramuscular in 15 and 5 times over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity according to intravenous application showed no safety-related concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety dimacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">Effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equates to 3-10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer who had received an anthracycline of about three quarters earlier.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with that of a conventional paclitaxel containing medication (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs and that it does not have to be given to other drugs to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxane BioScience Limited approval for the marketing of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophertness &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or a severe sensory neuropathy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory neuropathy Grade 3, the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired kidney function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel that could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophentists increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the amount of thrombocytes again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly defined cardiotoxicity was not proven in conjunction with Abraxane, cardiac incidence in the indicated patient population is not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients after the gift of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetics and constipient methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to produce no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised about a sperm conserving before treatment, since the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often) which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most notable haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Side effects listed in Table 1 are listed in conjunction with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally, increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactodehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagy, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimations of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules active substance that promotes the relocation of microtubules from the tubulbar and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transmits the transctose of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved trance-endothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and due to the albuminating protein SPARC (secretted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two unrelated unrelated studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, receiving paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity over paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy following the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous injection of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravasculinary distribution and / or soft bandaging of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values of a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane dosage (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-diihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged drug was 4% of the total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients aged over 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and, as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">A sterile syringe is injected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution into a Abraxane flow bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete resuspension of the powder is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinks are visible, the water bottle must be inverted softly, in order to achieve complete resuspension before application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packaging inserts. • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product, provided coolers for transport by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician whose experience in the treatment of patients with diseases is indicated for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietine deficiency or by not responding adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as an injection into a vein as part of a main study with 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems compared to the reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streamed under the skin had been studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were killed on Abseamed were maintained to the same degree as those receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied to patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations it was proven that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures Abseamed will provide information packages to the healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued approval for the marketing of Abseamed in the entire European Union to the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co. kg.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma that receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volumes (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood Abseamed may be used before a large elective orthopaedic procedure in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Haemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except paediatric patients in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in patients with or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control anaemia and anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia that is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl are increased compared to the baseline value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, an approach to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), for which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, Abseamed should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should preoperatively preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug to the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropoetin in erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a streamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are not eligible for a greater elective orthopaedic procedure and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escoronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenie (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of appetite, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the common causes of a non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxidation, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes, index) is decreased (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency the upper limit of haemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating active ingredients (ESA) were given a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the administration of epoeins if the hemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The rise in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of haemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should be considered a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa administration and erythropoietin response (patients that may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) a month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dosage adjustment with the goal of holding the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients with greater elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly, if possible prior to epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a greater elective orthopaedic procedure should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that epoetin alfa can pose an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events for patients with an initial hum of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins were not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">Epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">More than thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial indemics, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemic attacks, ischemic thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, retinal thromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovasculent occurrences (see Section 4.4 and 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in the serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women the risk of fracture fractures was reduced by 70% in patients with acupa (without other osteoporosis therapies) over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to all patients under Acrelia (with or without other osteoporosis therapies) with those of placebo the risk of hip fractures decreased by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Acrelia had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Acrelia must not be applied to patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to coledroneic acid or other bisphosphonate or any other component.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Acrelia are exposed to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonnecrosis (the death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides explanatory material for physicians to prescribe the Acrelia for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited to approve Aclasta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic fracture fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic fracture fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed solely by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Morbus Paget with Acrelia, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suppressed low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orphan or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Acrelia infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorders (see Section 4.4) In patients with a Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data on safety and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Acrelia is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypocemia is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with acupa (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia develops, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of acupa (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Prior to an application of bisphosphonates, breast cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene should be considered with appropriate preventive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who need dental surgery, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of acetamina (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving Acrelia (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Acrelia (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable in the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change of the Creatinin-Clearance (measured each year before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited renal function in osteoporosis were more than three years comparable between the placebo group and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">Temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Acrelia compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), compared to 21% of patients treated with Acrelia in the Morbus-Paget-studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the study on preventing clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus-Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently suppressed hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Acrelia (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of cioledron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw area have been reported, especially in cancer patients, via osteonekroses (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including acoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteondrosis in the jaw area of a patient treated with Acrelia and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-Score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 and at least two light or moderate-heavy current spinal fractures ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures significantly decreased over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebrate fractures compared with placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on fracture fractures Acrelia showed a constant effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Acrelia significantly increased bone density at lumbar vertebrae, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the femur hanger by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients treated with Acrelia (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic mud.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Acrelia reduced BSAP by 30% after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortalities were 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared with 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Acrelia treatment increased compared to placebo treatment the BMD at the total thigh and lower spine at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% at the total thigh and 4.3% lower than the placebo arm.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Acrelia-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of Acrelia was not inferior to the once weekly administration of alendronate in relation to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderate-heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of acoledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg risedronate once a day during 2 months was proven in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for acupa and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responses at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in the follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Risedronat, who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with Risedronat could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the top value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulatory cycle with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination phase t ½ h 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the 5 to 15 minutes infusion was reduced by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at the time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of the metabolized by cytochrom-P450 enzymatic systems is unlikely, because cioledroneic acid is not metabolized by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Coliedron acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinin-Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">The result is that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a creatinin-Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adaptation of the coledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since only limited data is available for severe kidney dysfunctions (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC, six times the recommended human therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of cioledroneic acid was given in rats with doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (an cumulative dosage that corresponds to the 7times of human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver as well as at the intravenous injection site occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common infection in repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysiology of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was measured at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="671">Citric acid is a substance called bisphosphonate which is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Morbus Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Morbus Paget the bone structure is too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="686">Before you end the treatment with Acrelia Falls you are considering the completion of the treatment with Aclasta, please make your next appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion often occur (with more than 30% of patients), but after the subsequent infusions, however, are less frequent.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headaches, occur within the first three days after the administration of Acrelia.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients) that cannot be adequately set with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonyish substance or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin is to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">This led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered by using doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of Actos added to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients showing Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to spoglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for the marketing of Actos across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is poorly adjusted with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (i.e. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone should not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark resins, liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be continued until the clinical evaluation of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can agitate from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with spoglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.1% and insulin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia is the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, treatment with thiazolidindia, including Pioglitazone, was reported about an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the incidence of macular edema, but declining doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">Fracture incidence accounted for 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant and if a patient wishes to have pregnancy or if this occurs, the treatment should be dismissed (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized from these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turgor and refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents over three times lower the upper limit of the normal range were as common as in placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than in placebo, when Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="796">During the trial period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is omitted (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">After two years of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by spoglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacides).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was poorly adjusted with insulin despite three months of optimization were randomised to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">Patients under Pioglitazone reduced the average HbA1c value by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to have insulin only; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotients proved to be statistically significant compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetic patients on 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL cholesterol level and an increase in the HDL cholesterol level and a minor but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol level were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo no statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazone, while lower levels of metformin and Gliclacide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the glandular triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, this both about an effect on triglyceride Absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to receive either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered spoglitazone in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness of approximately three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it was possible to prove that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in faeces (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination time of immutable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies coincided with mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric perhypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia resulting from hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindia led to increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">Fracture incidence accounted for 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each Pioglitazone or Gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotients proved to be statistically significant in comparison with the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the glandular triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, this both via an effect on the Tryglyceride Absorption and the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study failed to meet its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortalities, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation of the ankle, coronary revascularisation and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a quick initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">For example, patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy can perceive the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in strength, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (due to recombinant DNA versus insulin in animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adaptation is required when switching to Accord, it can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can, however, develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have dexterous pieces, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Seriousness hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effect lasts up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Absorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fisher (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients Since there is no experience in organ transplant recipients, Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular diseases In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other resinous medicines, acute toxicity may occur during the course of treatment, because of the reduction of the serum acid level, uric acid deposits can initially be mobilised in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">For example in malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan syndrome), the absolute concentration of xanthin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">During the phase 3 clinical studies, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before beginning the febuxostate- treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyllin Zwas did not conduct drug interactions with Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylline (inhibiting the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous gift of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in Febuxostature exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorothiazide / warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active substance required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an antacid, which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delays the absorption of febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be related to the side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machinery or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the reported cardiovascular events was observed in the overall febuxoid group in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) Side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients for up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostate- treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to indications.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypotesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, shortness of skin, skin discoloration, skin lesions, erectile dysfunction, increase in blood concentration in blood, decrease in blood lymphocyte, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed a statistically significant superiority of both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the usual dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1219">The primary efficacy endpoint with ADENURIC was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum acid concentrations in subjects, regardless of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from phase 3 open in two years showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheumatism, so that less than 3% of patients in the months 16-24 required a treatment against a feeding.</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout node, resulting in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the toxicity up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with feebuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg are proportionate.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional rise.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage of serum acid concentration was observed, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unaltered febuxostat (3%), whose well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over urine, approximately 45% of the dose was found in the chair as unaltered febuxostat (12%), Acylgluconide of the active substance (1%), whose well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased about 1.8 times from 7,5 m g / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ / ml in the group with heavy whipping function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- / gh-classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh-classification B) Liver dysfunction, the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, with about 11-times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific Purinmetabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been noted that Febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were approximately 3 times higher than the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity was observed, accompanied by a reduction in the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place in the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in relation to increasing the vitamin D level.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) in patients treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), ulcers (Ulcera) of esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), inflated abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as acidic bulging.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components ADROVANCE should not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It should not be used in case of diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe ophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenalulcera were rare (after market introduction), among them some severe and with complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines, without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronate leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecrosis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>

<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, Alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically important change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the average range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats show that, after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, Alendronate temporarily distributes tissue into soft tissue, but then rapidly dispersed into the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the faeces.</seg>

<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; reformulation of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close monitoring of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of agraph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraph, the Tacrolimus-Talmirrors should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a tallow, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus-Talmirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules, so this conversion has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a change of other immunosuppressive immunosuppressants on a daily basis, the treatment with the oral initial dose for the prevention of corneal graft rejection must begin with the oral initial dosage recommended in case of renal and liver transplant.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Can adaptation in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood talkingin the target range may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not influence the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum increments, a calculation of the ininence and supervision of the urinary tract) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraph When switching from a Ciclosport to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in the individual case under the aid of full-blood-Tacrolimus-Talmirrors controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus-Talmirrors during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-talkes of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to lawyer, dose adaptation, changes in immunosuppressive therapy, or while using substances that could change the tacrolimus-blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As an advisor is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days before the state has entered the state.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talmirrors of Tacrolimus in the first time after liver transplants are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur as a result of tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; reformulation of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close monitoring of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus's blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with lawyer (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea there is a particularly careful observation of the Tacrolimus-concentration in the blood, as the Tacrolimus-blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, a chamber or septum hypertrophy was described as cardiomyopathy, which can therefore also occur under agraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, liquid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction was found with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole and with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines, which are metabolized by CYP3A4, which impair metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of Steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormone exposition, it is particularly careful when making decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments showed that tacrolimus potentially reduces the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialymable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Impact mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12) responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus inhibits the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily Prograf capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant after pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 lung transplanted patients, 475 patients undergoing pancreas transplantation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant were used as primary immunosuppressive.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf included in these published studies the observations in the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multicenter trial with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tacrolimus or ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, the bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, 21,7% of cases were related to the emergence of a bronchial obliteran compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were killed by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the incidence of bronchitis obliteration syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multi-center trial with oral prograf was conducted to 205 patients who underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which were randomised to receive Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (by protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired level of sebum from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressive after transplantation showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional doses of anti-leukin-2 antagonists Daclimus, lower initial doses of tacrolimus which lead to Talmirrors between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant irradiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can be concluded that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In the case of stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus-Talmirrors during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be effective against other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation lawyer.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder due to the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was examined.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of Advance in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septics with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advantages (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocate may not be applied to patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Baxter AG company for the transfer of Advocates throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, the place and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">For the following hemorrhagic events factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma sign (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute depression are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, a proper determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">In response to factor VIII, individual patients can differ in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be determined according to the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk depends on genetic and other factors within the first 20 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and anamnestic known inhibitory development, following conversion from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the recurrence of (low-) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which occurred in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (each with 3 patients).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (often not estimated on the basis of available data).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained over the whole period and both the factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient levels on the 15th of postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE an 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2,4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), a FVIII inhibitor was detected after exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients from a clinical trial 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated patients with factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, the incidence of urticaria, preuritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes in several repeated product expositions was reported in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk balance as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSUR every 6 months, has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited distributed the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially with the fact that the company withdraws its application for the insertion of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, bones or soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been changed in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who found Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of documents submitted initially, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on tag 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore benefits the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the recovery has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeronaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerobaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and should be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy was the changes in the severity of the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients reported that the symptoms of Aerobaze were 46.0% compared with 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aeropaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received desiatadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerotaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeronaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to chloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosaze may not be used in patients suffering from hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism) or haemorrhagic strokes (cerebral haemorrhage) or haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of aeroplanes throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however it is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy, aerosol should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease with time in case of long-term application.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, lisinid, Cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aeronaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aeronaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of loratadin were observed in the course of clinical trials with desiatadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with chloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether they were alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vivo CYP3A4 inhibited, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate is nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconvenience of the use of aerobics during pregnancy is not assured, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness that can lead to impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, mental alertness, cyantic, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precorral pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophilen as well as the inhibition of the expression of the P-selectivity in endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an adult dose study with adults, Lloratadin showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance, including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aeropaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerobaze tablets was significantly higher than in monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with a loratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">In view of gender, age or ethnicity, the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets did not show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of an individual dose-dose-study of Aerobaze pharmacokinetics, desiatadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of loratadin, 3 hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four test subjects were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure to the gift of an aeropaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety precautionary studies, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Deschloratadin can however not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmaceutical vigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the Authorisation Application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerobaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and constricting or itchy eyes while constilling the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases when using Aeronaze: • High blood pressure • heart chasing, palpitations • cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headaches or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aeronaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">In case of application at the recommended dosage, it is not expected that Aeronaze will lead to dizziness or reduce the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aeronaze, as you should notify your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of Aeronaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten taking Aeronaze If you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulties, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of heart palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver values, were also very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilisat for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children from one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruples, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius led to an average decrease of the number of symptoms (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, in comparison to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies of Urticaria, the decrease in the number of symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the use of desiatadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms end and can be resumed after returning.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), a prolonged treatment can be recommended for the patient during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with chloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness caused by impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study with 578 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common side-effect headache, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desiatadin and at 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multilayer trial, which was administered up to 45 mg of desioradin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophilen as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which Desloratadin was administered at a dose of up to 20 mg a day.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which Deschloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Lloratadin showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated on behalf of further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology regardless of the etiology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited more easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine deficiency is a causative factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that, besides the chronically idiopathic urticaria, it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving preuritus and the reduction of size and number of dads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Alzheimer's disease compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which patients' patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved higher concentration of desiatadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Quoradin in vivo does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate is nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with chloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of loratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional safety precautionary studies, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Lloratadin can not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colourless film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmine (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Erius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosing upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children from 2 to 11 years are metabolized loratadin and experience higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metabolize normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems should not use fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomaltine insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in an additional dose of adults and adolescents, where up to 45 mg of Desperate adin (nine times clinical dose) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came into question for an antihistamine treatment received a daily reclamation dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desiatadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of loratadin in adults may be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Deschloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg a day.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study for adults and adolescents, in which Deschloratadin was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily (the neoplastic dose) over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents had no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single-day dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets led to no impairment of the psychomotor system in adults and adolescents in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of alcohol-induced performance impairment nor an increase in sleepiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving preuritus and the reduction of size and number of dads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully-metabolizing phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose trials, AUC and Cmax values of loratadin in pediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received desiatadin syrup at a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. was officially approved by the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), that the company will withdraw its application for the transfer of Aflunov to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus as" "" "endogenous" "" "and antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to develop antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus of this common ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a body alien) was purified, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but it cannot be taken together with kritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the antiviral drugs of the patient first, and the likelihood of the virus is to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase decreases the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The use of low-dose kritonavir was compared with other proteasinhibitors in 206 adults who used to use protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks under asgenerase, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than in placebo, but asgenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the generic medicine Agenerase increased viral load after 16-week treatment as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came to a greater decrease in the viral load after four weeks, together with kritonavir, compared with the patients who further increased their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amponavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenerase should not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are mined in the same way as asgenerase and are injected in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking asgenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis, or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years from the risks associated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the use of asgenerase in combination with kritonavir in patients who previously did not have protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "asgenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of permission for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited to approve the marketing of asgeneraliases across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasthenic (PI) -pretreated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amponavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amponavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and patient pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amponavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than capsules of amponavir; hence, asgenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amponavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amponavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amponavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with mediocre liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction can be reduced to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">"" "" "" "asgenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent substrates of the cytochromium P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amponavir during the ingestion of amponavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asgenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current anti-retroviral therapy, including treatment with asgenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including the Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of asgenerase with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determination of the active ingredient are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amponavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if there are still low doses of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycollimation of the asgenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be used cautiously in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">If a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus have been reported.</seg>

<seg id="1956">In the case of haetihilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorrhoids are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteondrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrate with low therapeutic latitude must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and also represent substrates of the cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 Substrate with low therapeutical latitude Agenerase with kritonavir must not be given along with drugs, whose active ingredients are primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC by amponavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the lower plasma levels caused by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum mirrors of amponavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the virus level and if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax it is reduced by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amponavir were used twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, confirming the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Ampriavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ampriavir in plasma, which were reached twice a day in the combination of amponavir (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amponavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amponavir and caletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study on the use of didanosine in combination with didanosine, but it is recommended that the incomes of didanosin and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amponavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggest that nevirapine may lower the serum concentration of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution must be taken because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be made, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and ritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amponavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with asgenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dosage, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once a day led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69x compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may result in interactions with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines, when used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenerase as it may cause resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israfeel pin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, Israelican pin, nifedipin, Israthipine, may be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with asgenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluoroonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol diminished by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of generic ase with kritonavir is not recommended together with these glucocorticoids unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amponavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to stabilization of the mirrors as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased simultaneously with the addition of amponavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenerase should not be used together with an orally taken midazolam (see section 4.3), while with the simultaneous use of asgenerase with parenteral midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if there are still low doses of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation how to adjust the amponavirus dose if Ampriavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">If warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are present together with asgenerase, an increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time administration of asgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother as compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amponavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether Ampriavir is passed into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the nesting into the uterus until the end of the breast-feeding of amponavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive ability was not impaired by the administration of amponavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of asgenerasis was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the treatment failure.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to taking Agenerase or any other medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg asgenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) occurred under the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fac subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsal fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral individuals who had been treated with amponavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (pin-jaw) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 performed in 245 NRTI- pretreated patients under Ampriavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapular nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel treatment with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonnecrosis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients receiving 600 mg Agenerase twice a day together with low dose kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) were similar; an exception formed increases of triglycerides and CPK values, which in patients who received Agenerase together with low-dosed kritonavir were very frequent.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the case of an overdose, the patient must observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ampriavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag polyproteinesis stages with the result of formation of unmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amponavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibition (IC50) of amponavir lies in the range between 0,012 and 0.08 µM in the case of acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in the case of chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other kritonavir-based treatment schemes with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described above were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700 mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be studied genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance pattern similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I51V, V77I, I85V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based on genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasthenic resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I62V, V82A / C / F / M, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing clinical validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasthenic resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ampriavir associated genetic samples creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between amponavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients, with whom a Fosamprenavir (one of them pointed out resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tipranavir), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Ampriavir keeps its activity against some other proteashrinhibitors resistant insulates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early abandonment of a preventive therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of asgenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which adults treated with PI (viral load ≥ 1000 copies per day) and nucleocarcinoma (NRTI) or standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly acquired with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the time-adjusted average change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-failure threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of uncontaminated rabbits is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children between 2 and 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose of kritonavir was given at the same time; most of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell counts of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbundled" "" "asgeneraliases should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amponavir amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% elevated, for Cmax by contrast, reduced by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amponavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amponavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amponavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an unimpeded penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unconnected amponavir, which represents the active portion, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with asgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of asgenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amponavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amponavir is available from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; hence, asgenerase solution and asgenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal dysfunction on the elimination of amponavir and ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amponavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained by healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amponavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term study of carcinogenicity with amponavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas in male animals appeared in dosages containing the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application, little evidence suggests the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in vitro and in vitro gene otoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphom test, micro-core test of rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes were neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Ampriavir in plasma, which were reached twice a day in the combination of amponavir (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amponavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amponavir and caletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amponavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be made, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and ritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with asgenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluoroonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol diminished by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">If warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are present together with asgenerase, an increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease of the AUC and Cmin from amponavir by 22% or.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amponavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibition (IC50) of amponavir lies in the range between 0,012 and 0.08 µM in the case of acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in the case of chronic infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Ampriavir keeps its activity against some other proteashrinhibitors resistant insulates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbundled" asgeneraliases should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with asgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">Also, the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible; therefore, the effect of a renal dysfunction on the elimination of amponavir and ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term study of carcinogenicity with amponavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas in male animals were observed in dosages that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-times (rat) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatoo-cellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2211">The most frequent contributors and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream in connection with side effects in studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Patients reported from 185 with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream in connection with side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with Imiquimodine-treated patients with actinent keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical signs indicated by the test plan show that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod cream three times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream often occurred to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / flattening (23%) and oedema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The assessment of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these studies with Imiquimod cream five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream was very common (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe shrinkage and scarring (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The unintentional oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotony that normalized after orally or intravenous hydration.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was possible to show that efficacy in relation to complete healing of the suitability of the hands during Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of the total of 119 patients treated with Imiquimod treated patients completely; this was 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared with 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimod with five-time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic, hypertrophic inflammations within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined follow-up studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications for external seizures, actinent keratose and basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and have therefore not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages investigated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic exposure of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinent keratose was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml for use in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod by topical application on MC-diseased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinent keratose or superficial alkaline cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">Doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight in a four-month study of dermal toxicity in the rat; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application also yielded similar effects in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice at the maler administration on three days a week did not induce tumours in the area of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is unknown, but since Imiquimod only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk to the human being due to systemic exposure to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream, formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the treatment of enzymes in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, hampers movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the medicine, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect in terms of reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under 5 years, Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver disease at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed at more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of the pulmonary function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strong hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check every year all new information that may be known, and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyms in response to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the marketing of Aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme sales in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyma can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any adverse side-effect that occurs during infusion or by the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be conducted in an appropriate clinical setting, where rehabilitation facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that virtually all patients with IgG antibodies against laronidase usually form within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a prolonged interval, a hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautiously preceded due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have decreased, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyms should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to quench during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were mostly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3- study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe follow-up and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenous 100 E / kg once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion came within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe sequential form usually within one month with a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 trial (or up to premature excretion from the study), 13 / 45 patients had no assay demonstrated by radioimmunopoiesis (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom there was never a seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with mild to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was detected in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The justification for the hydrolysis of the enzyme is the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients had the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an increased expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms each week for another 3,5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazymes showed improvement in lung function and ability to be cured in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG mirror in urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was detected, which remained constant to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients, which was considered clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected per normal feV, distance in 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, mainly for the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe lead form and 4 with mean cross-country form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe sequential form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle vascular system showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe sequential form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute salary tests.</seg>
<seg id="2331">Intravenous 100 E / kg once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetric acid slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetric into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural othelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimo was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom the cancer did not attack squamous cell cells showed longer survival times when administered by Alimb compared with the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transfer of Alimo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominantly panel-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominantly plate-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the end of the telemetric infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">A corticosteroid is required to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions on the day before and during the day of the telemetric treatment as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">At least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days prior to the first dose and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period and for another 21 days after the last dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first telemetric dosage as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetric drugs, a complete blood image should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the neadir of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that apply to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio- or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, there is an increased risk of side effects compared to patients under the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limitation of &gt; 1.5-times of the upper bilirubin threshold and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marching and must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophatic number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the amount of thrombocytes again ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophytes, the number of thrombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in the previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-atmatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetric acid must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce the toxicity of treated patients (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogias (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyloric acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with telemetric acid (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a mixed therapy is provided, must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with a telemetric mixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred were associated risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion is to be weighed in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in translatular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with phemboxed occasionally when this substance was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversibly hardening of the reproductive capacity is made by means of telemetric mixed, men should be advised before the treatment instructions to consult with regard to the sperm preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogiants (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g a day) can result in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is required if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and less than 2 days after treatment with telemetric mixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data on the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with a telemetric mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetric mixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, serious birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It must not be applied during pregnancy except if it is obligatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is made possible by means of telemetric acid, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether it is possible to skip metry-mixed into breast milk and unwanted effects on breastfed infants can not be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetric xed) is an antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetric acid acts as antifolate with multiple targets by blocking thymidylatsynthase (DHFR) and Glycinemamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and Purtin ucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, easy-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically important advantage of a median 2.8-month survival compared to patients treated with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase when alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the anti-diabetic is necessary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">In a study on the interaction of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the dose of a single dose of Amiodarone, a slight decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and depend on the pharmacological effect of the medicine, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported side effects, which were detected after the market launch of orlistat, is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days with normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">With the majority of cases reported after the market launch, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the lipid properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is applied in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastrisch and pankreatic Lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical trials it was deduced that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaline, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: changes in body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg - 2.4% (baseline: 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (output value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, given the minimal systemic resorted dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after secession of the N-form yl-leucine group) were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alohxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, which are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years is not recommended because there is not enough information to the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5 hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to which receptors in the intestines are prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies Aloxi was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate causes for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy, no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy, no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alohxi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy based on cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute ileus after injection should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous dispensing of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt- Interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy administration, Aloxi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron uninhibitedly did not inhibit tumor activity of the five chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady State- Concentration oral Metocloplamids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micrograms (633 patients), which were at least associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar occurrences of adverse events appeared as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume a dialysis is probably not effective therapy with an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life 7,3 hours) were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indicating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular depletion and reolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of intravenous Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous injections, a gradual elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC 0- ∞) are generally dosed in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once intravenous intravenous dose of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days, total textual position (AUC 0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the addition of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination According to an intravenous 10 microgram / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to a unique intravenous injection in healthy eyes, the total body size was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance was 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, terminale eliminations and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only for exposures considered sufficient over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, indications revealed that Palonosetron can only block ionic canals in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and reolarization and can prolong the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in the thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the application of the approval for the placing of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alphis should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damages and the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally increases.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been injected into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that attest to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed should not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease returned to more patients than with the reference medical drug; Alphis also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study used in the study for examining the question of how far the drug acts as an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not validated adequately.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected laths (crack or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not affect this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients with age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients in placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in front-dogs, approximately 90% of patients from both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (stomach-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were detectable or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed by the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirsts, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the marketing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient in clinical studies of secondary-infected open wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical treatment (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to an oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% on the skewed skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not deemed necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in regards to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with altargo should be continued / terminated, it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections which Altargo used was the most commonly reported side-effect irritation at the location which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptidyltransfer, partially block P-Binding-Interaction and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms appear questionable due to the local prevalence of resistance, consultation with experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus were detected, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily with occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before mediating and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 shackled skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, less involved in CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mice lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus achieving up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 shredded skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were found in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-fold estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing application (version 6.2), is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market undertakes to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and all additional updates of the RMP agreed with CHMP in the 1.8.2 module.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use," the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Show irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area, you should quit the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if you have not been specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It should not be applied in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment turns on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-stage vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and it is ensured that the two doses can lead to an end of the existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defence of the body), "as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix has the same ingredients as the inoculated Vaccine of Twinrix, which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved by the Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix Adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambiani and Twinrix Adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the protection of Ambirix was similar to a six and a 12 month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 Vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals company.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the immobilization with Ambirix is made up of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster vaccination is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies observed after priming with the combination vaccine lie in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully ensured that immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine may need a booster as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even with no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody-value after priming under certain circumstances, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraepidermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneously, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambiani was administered in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheritis, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that a sufficient immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was similar to the frequency observed in previous thiomerisation and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matriculation on a basis of calculation per accination dose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of subjects compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects which had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to proband (i.e. over the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received ambient amplification, compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and matriculation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vaccine, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated Hepatitis B and surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years, the serum convergence rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum convergence rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3-dose vaccine than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2 doses vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12 - and including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambiani was administered at the same time with the booster shots of a combined diphtheritis, tetanus, acellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient on all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotations and serum conversions for the current formulation as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resusenation of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that might necessitate hospitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete trial of 2 cans has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B before the two vaccines are administered (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may result from itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has already experienced an allergic reaction to a former vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to quickly protect against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective constituents per accination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective components is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected to individuals who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child are weak due to illness or treatment in your body's immune system, or if you / your child will undergo a tick analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction on the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines (including those whom you can get without enrolment) or if you have been vaccinated against a short time or if you have received / / or have received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambiani is not administered by pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ A very common case (doses more than 1 case per 10 doses): • pain or discomfort on the puncture point or redness • Matteousness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ Frequently (up to 1 case per 10 inoculated doses): • swelling at the injection point • fever (over 38 ° C) • Headed • Gastro-intestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that were reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 reported doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally restricted or extensive rashes, which can be itching or can be vesicular, swelling of the eye contours and the face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden drop in blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like symptoms, including chills, muscle and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, dissensions such as tingling and "ant-running," multiple sclerosis, disorders of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Fainting infections of some blood vessels discomfort or disease, loss of appetite, diarrhea and abdominal pain Changes liver function tests lymph node swelling Exelevated inclination to bleeding or bruising (bruises), caused by rubbish the blood platelet amount.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known since the first approval for the placing of the market, the CHMP unanimously assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix is only marketed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonary can also be used in prehistory for patients at the age of over a month with complementary encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammontane becomes - split into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose to the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonwealth could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonium rapeseed in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonwealth was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information on this medicine was available due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete lack of enzymes already manifests in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for use if there is hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow the tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day must be obtained with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets should not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing as there is a risk for the formation of oesophagulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and odema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat takes place over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Under subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate at young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neuronal reproduction slowed down and increased neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of those adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with Laktatazidosis, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity for intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic compound which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate, taken for each gram, can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was previously almost always infaust and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogs within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative means of nitrogen deposition (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (but within the first life-month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first onset of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">The survival rate was 98% in patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornicotylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits can hardly be reversible even during treatment and a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism, and with repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">According to an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after ingesting measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary bladder problems or haemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) could not be detected in plasma after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma sign were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrat with toxic and non-toxic cans had no apparent effects (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are taken orally (babies and children who are not yet able to swallow the tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or through a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), lesions occurred in the pyramidal cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with Laktatazidosis, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate, taken for each gram, can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits can hardly be reversible even during treatment, and a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form 15 minutes after ingesting measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products, which accumulate after consuming proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">You should not take AMMONAPS during breastfeeding as the medicine could pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, obstruction of the ear, disorientation, memory problems and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating the appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss taking AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS on the same single doses or via a gastric (tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (tube that is led through the nose to the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Submit a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess pellet. • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoons granulate from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress lift" (abnormal measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If anox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack help maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another antibody) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While PCI was often used as a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent a closure), other medicines were used to prevent blood clots like abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the Gift of GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to biobrudin, other hirudine, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a hemorrhage, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and for a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous boldus of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is PCI in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Just before the procedure, a bolt load of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous boldus of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, reconstituted and diluted medicinal products should be carefully mixed before use and the dose of bolus can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restrictions (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second cycle dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adaptation at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemoglobin system and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most bleeding from arterial points occurs in case of PCI patients suffering from arterial points of puncture, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during treatment, in principle, bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with a bivourodin, supervision of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be taken into account to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with bivourodin is reached the level prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregates), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemoglobal parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental investigations are insufficient in regards to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, weaving or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bicvalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to bias invader plus GPI / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either non-fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudin Group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, adverse events were more common in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleedings like in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding often occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidin / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area requiring radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma with a diameter ≥ 4 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed localized localisations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctuation points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bivouchers at 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin Group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, adverse events were more common in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organclasses in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of an overdose, the treatment with a biobrudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains biobrudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both the catalytic centre and the anionic binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of thromboine.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin was unable to induce any thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduziated thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentric anticoagulatory effect that is covered by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI was subsequently performed in the following patients, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST uplift (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPI / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or with PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, requiring angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the three treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or not to process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from the humanoid, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of time than a short-acting humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin can not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transfer of Apidra across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or administered subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin needs in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the mode of action, the brand (producer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delaying, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can cause a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or termination of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effect of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment scheme changes.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, propoxyphene, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic antiirritation can be attenuated or missing under the influence of limesolytics such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reservoirs.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin inducing occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk nor is it absorbed by oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable pharmacies known from clinical studies grouped according to system organclasses and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, lightheadedness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is failed to change the injection point within the injection area continuously, can occur subsequently a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous injections of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be hospitalized in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with a cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes melli- tus showed insulin-lulisin in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg a dose-proportional draft glucose-lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves total glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Humaninsuline.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is achieved in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with the normal normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin plissin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, better postpranial control than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin pulses are applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved such as the normal normal insulin, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin sensitivity in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal was given before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to more humane normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin sensitivity in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the start of the meal compared to human normal maliners, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
