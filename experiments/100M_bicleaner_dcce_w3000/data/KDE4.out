package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to access .
further information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Set@@ ting Exten@@ sions .... Open the tool@@ box Tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of default settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may need more modules on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the module pin filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools An@@ gle Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the current working directory can be filtered in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View is to map ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies by means of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle , which is switched over View color mode , can display either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or mapping of a different file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it will be displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of child rectang@@ les should be used ( and thus , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rec@@ tangle ) .
in the display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of the entries , and these frames require space , which is then no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rec@@ tangle is square .
how to partition the space of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames to create rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive dup@@ lic@@ ates .
you can specify the minim@@ ally shown area for an entry using the menu entry View . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a child entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the use of C@@ ach@@ eg@@ ra .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools Picture Gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Image Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the Pictures per line option has a sli@@ der and a rotating field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the check box File name of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails .
with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box image size indicate whether the size of the images below the thumb@@ nails is displayed in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a sli@@ der or a rotating field to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
using the Candi@@ date Com@@ mentary file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box You can specify a different color depth than in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu in the Navigation Pan@@ e window or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
changing browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or where you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses access with this browser , change the browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access to browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to access the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly represented with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting .
by menu entry ... you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ Style templates and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu on Tools website . you can make the following checks :

an easy to use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
&amp; Edit ; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as the camera or the lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; nbsp ; attempts to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry to report problems or desires .... This opens a dialog with a broken link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; nbsp ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developers will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to encourage you to join the user &apos;s mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ box ; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ;
the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; Edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder here . just enter path names or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data reconciliation is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; Edit ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; Edit ; looks at each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during browsing the folder you will get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; Edit ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively def@@ aults the library path in its enti@@ rety . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this can be done by adding a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change it by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can in &amp; Edit ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Reporting Tool to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can work as well ; possibly handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w @-@ library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy to use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often registered as a disk drive . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ ates . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses g@@ photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera as@@ . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is meanwhile ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be reliably read by digi@@ K@@ am . if the if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to develop K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; Edit ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
moving and dropping images works everywhere : you can put a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only constra@@ int is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the filen@@ ame only works when this ind icon view is also displayed . which fields are displayed , you can configure the settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was created first .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . to do this , select album Import Photos . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Import screen shot .
to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the pop @-@ up menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos . if you want to add or delete new collections Up collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums Fol@@ lowing date .
the buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder .
when you first select an album in &amp; Edit ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ eper . this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; nbsp ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be shown in this album in the image window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview using the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a bit while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using all preview images in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be shown below the appropriate preview . what information is this , you can edit via Settings ; modify the albums page and customize the thumb@@ nails section to suit your needs .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the cursor a moment over an image . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all that is about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can access all the features with &amp; Edit ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either the F@@ 4 Picture ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit ... . in the Edit section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image editing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; Edit ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail with the right mouse button and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 to ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; Edit ; delete it , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del Case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My date sli@@ ps ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; Edit ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the View View . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos that have been selected using this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also locate parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ gn@@ ment ; to fold , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so , you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported in the loss of the database once &amp; after ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either to &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select Create New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , it will become the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the keyword name and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select as a night@@ mare preview in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the picture to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
to make use of the functionality with keywords , first you need to apply your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the pictures you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword al@@ erts from the context menu .
you can specify a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword to each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have given a picture with keywords , it will appear below the thumb@@ nail in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you click with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photos and select from the Tags menu Remove . the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a chron@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rec@@ tangle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this appears in the list below .
includes all database elements : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and more in the future .
next to this search box is a small lamp that will be green if the search hits matches . if you click here , the filtering will be cleared and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you will get a simple search box like the one described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criteria .
if you are happy with your selection , press the header OK and the search is done . the results are used in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your search again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select Search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information previously entered . if you select Edit as advanced search , the dialog for Advanced search appears to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching . more information can be found in the Advanced Search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete Search in the context menu .
advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list with search group / delete search group . any option can be linked to others over the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or at least ... or at least ... . furthermore , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . by using a sponge the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; Edit ; finds the matching images . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it down and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to view a square . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Fol@@ lowing the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window will be opened . if you are back in &amp; Edit ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ ous table with L Tools .
from the preview toolbar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you can select the preview from the toolbar and execute Zoo or Ver@@ shooting operations on one of the images , you can also compare them to the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited for fast sorting out of a series of images . if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the left pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available in the light table for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling feature , which you recognize on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the Pre@@ view mode both images will display the same image area .
the zoom works exactly as in other views . simply use the zoom control below the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos capture , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , protect , protect and use photos . we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , reporting , archiving , optimizing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data on data . according to your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find a specific photo no longer without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ tise ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you maintain anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will need to switch to a larger drive at some point .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . dis@@ connect new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the metadata store option to be stored in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed in the settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts as you should assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to every photo . of course , you can select all the images that the same attribute may need and then set the value . it makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work .
now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you often refer to other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . converting the tree within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while the sub@@ tree tracks .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let most people see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to get in touch with your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . thus , the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him about the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; Edit ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images to web galleries , you will need to tell the story for publishing no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export the photos at the location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information should be stored in the configuration page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; it should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the image to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the image is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright paragra@@ phs though they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this , in the picture embedded metadata . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; Di@@ gest ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you can find problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these should be dealt with carefully and you can &apos;t trust them for more than a few years . of course , you can buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality that last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to perform miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray Disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disc@@ laim@@ er keeps your statistics for you . your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disk drives on this topic : floppy error study
in brief : disks will last longer when operating in the Temper@@ ature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reason is that S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT are due to the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are in particular Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and Verlag@@ s@@ counting ler . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only a complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also restore data loss due to a power failure before saving the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account for electric sho@@ cks , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also includes over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it ful@@ fills the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to phone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over @-@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for lap@@ tops and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over @-@ voltage protection protects your system against smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system . if you buy an UPS then you should be sure that it ful@@ fills the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in case of electricity disrup@@ tions with the costs to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
you are at home compared to the hard drives home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . it is too slow for that .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are refer@@ enced in photos . their free store is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory what should be verified in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . due to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies included a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures that the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive is safe .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these faults remain un@@ discovered until a day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . nobody seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebooks and 46 % for work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the percentage of th@@ ef@@ ts is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most widespread file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . what is meant is that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural barrier for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteri@@ or@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by data loss every year . so backup your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash will strike you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aer@@ op@@ lanes : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a frequent reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generate multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this f@@ use comes with an version@@ ing system closest to the exception that is only sam@@ pled and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure lets you discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete check .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retained X@@ MP files , retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , sight devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at everything that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to swal@@ low a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the print outlet for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t app@@ end it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ yte ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # to change the size of travel if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if there is no more software you can read it yourself , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard of GIF . however , it can replace much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the draw@@ back is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF may be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now at your disposal and we hope that Canon and Nikon will also use it some@@ time .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource blocking quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; which stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . however , X@@ MP adapts to it because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , the raw format is dep@@ rec@@ ated . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; Edit , then you should add the metadata again . you may be cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Adding a Photos to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; Edit ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description for this can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
tab Metad@@ ata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufac@@ turers , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the Metad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is to click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ . in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you are using the buttons All you want to download or download selected , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only a few , you have to select them first and then delete the selected one .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so using the camera system , as this is much faster .
the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the data on the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC @-@ fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish another format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch the date &amp; time option to do so . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you are using the option to use camera names , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer .
the new file name , which is edited ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; nbsp ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ tise ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , it can &amp; Edit ; this is used to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is downloading . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. a folder cho@@ oser dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be done from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; users who want to locate the location of the photo thus , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . so , the question is actually more , how the data come into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and last via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you have to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool from Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the predefined coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle , for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; Edit ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to access these settings , you need to select Edit in the Settings menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ code ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image else &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC action stores the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the &amp; Edit database ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ code ; imported without getting lost .
save image in@@ scrip@@ tions as embedded in@@ scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other picture viewer .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor in the main window rests over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; Edit ; Alb@@ um@@ Fol@@ der that has none of these enh@@ ancements added , by &amp; Edit ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire from &amp; Edit can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings will be turned on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; All the image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can obtain better picture results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the PNG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not decrease image quality , since PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can switch the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality since the defect algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy resolution , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; Edit , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if you are sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance that is based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the sharp@@ ness . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned , because of the inability of your camera to look at the top lights as a continuous white . to do this , you can use the setting @-@ through white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results , as they can re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ w ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when choosing the Rec@@ on@@ set option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo account small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data , which come from the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as a C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
&amp; nbsp ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks so . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ es Direc@@ ted ) the quality for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction , as it is carried out during raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; Edit ; information as to translate color information from a color space to the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask when an image is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Can set the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; Edit ; Browse this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to lie down . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon that do not contain any colour mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given by a device . this is very useful before you print an image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what it is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon Profile Expansion lets you see the style for the finish : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface it can &amp; Edit ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these will then be edited by &amp; Edit ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the Pre@@ views .
short@@ cuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts .
for further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can use the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show on the left hand a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in picture display mode . currently , the camera supports serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; Edit ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin you can specify the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find further details in del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly edited by &amp; Edit ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; disable when starting . this may speed up the starting process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
setting When starting new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you whether it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; Edit ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit ; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view and edit your photos and to preview and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the item Display / Edit .
image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; they may not be part of your distribution . you may find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and underneath it the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu from the File menu or using the Rec@@ over of the Image Processing button in the toolbar . you will lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last save .
virtually any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the back or restore button on the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zoom out where you are using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the toolbar can be displayed . if you do not wish to do so , you can change it in the Edit Settings dialog . you can view it from the Edit window . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Ex@@ porting Pres@@ sure Wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; Edit ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the text is copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you have commented it , you either use the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels are then saved .
in addition to the Apply button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the pre@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the keyword overview shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; Edit ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search term . you can quickly restrict the number of options in search of a keyword . this capability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief for entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords may also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is indicated . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to give you keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and filed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be a or its , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry used in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . using a color @-@ administered workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to squee@@ ze for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image editions are via email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , adjust , automatic comparison and contrast expand from the menu Con@@ rigid Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the brightness values over the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
lev@@ elling : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . in this way , almost every brightness zone has the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
add contrast : this method enhances the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the largest possible area and a new ji@@ us@@ en@@ isation of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a bit limited as a color space is worked with 8 bits per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by copy@@ righ@@ ted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Col@@ ors White Balance Sheet Edi@@ ting .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance , click on the sub@@ window .
the target photos can be previ@@ ewed with a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that changes dynamically when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adju@@ sts you to improve the shadow details of your photos or also di@@ mm@@ ing down .
to play with the above controls , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Load exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also add another photo to your original . if you save these settings , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding also needs more disk space , calcul@@ ator time and is available only for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub @-@ window for brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under Col@@ ors Sound Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to use it for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; Edit ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ te filter .
in times of chemical processing , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was the effect of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar conversion effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot &quot; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation so that it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film manufactured by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contra@@ sting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can preview the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the converted problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the sli@@ der for the intended use purpose .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders can be cli@@ cked into it and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the controller and take care of how the picture changes .
the original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear display is most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ points can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ bs which can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded again later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , medium and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of adjusting input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most meaningful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the corresponding pixel pixels .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marker is to be seen . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change color gra@@ dations of the photo .
the Chann@@ els Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are at the bottom right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible h@@ iss that comes from the colour space . the color space consists of small art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise patterns look different in each channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the colored first .
the Save as and Load Buttons will be used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ ers setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue Channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is checked . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold to the att@@ un@@ es . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ ph@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using &amp; Edit ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait out of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu item Image texture can be used for this .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the relief model has been set to 200 .
with &amp; Edit ; adding tool frame can be a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter you set the required frame type for your picture . throughout the picture borders with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , truncated it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is 1 % to 50 % limited .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after the aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use@@ . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
using the &amp; Edit ; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you have to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to lower the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ code ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the root folder button in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder will appear . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the entire image , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus may be the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process needs to merge colors with minimal differences into one color point . this in turn results in blur@@ red edges becoming blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers turn a focus filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you get control over your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry to call up the Shar@@ p@@ ples .
you should do this carefully , because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus the tool through the menu entry . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tness with the menu entry Con@@ rigid sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter using the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out . an increase in the radius or the amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blur@@ ry mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges will create .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are hit by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference sum to be applied . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference with it for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from sharpen@@ ing and therefore f@@ law errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the painted picture the ( 2 ) . blur@@ ry mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; Edit ; tool re@@ focus re@@ foc@@ usses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it revers@@ es the default . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus usually achieves better results than blur@@ red mask .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is actually very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . this causes un@@ desired results .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is extremely blur@@ red then pay attention to hal@@ o @-@ ons .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further blur@@ b the image .
hot sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos; edge . use this parameter if your shar@@ per is G@@ auss . this is most often caused by a previously executed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos; sharp@@ ness . note , however , that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load Buttons will be used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the follow @-@ up methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob smooth@@ ens the blur@@ ring of the area which has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pre@@ adjustments as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to fine adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smo@@ othing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly smo@@ other than homogeneous regions . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
direction dependen@@ cy alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film or CCD Rau@@ schen , a high value will generate wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore set this value to match the degree of smo@@ othing in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles make a long runtime . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal , but it doubles the term . we recommend it to let it out .
the buttons Save as and Load exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with minor art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black Art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a poor movie overlay during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; Edit ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a fine @-@ gra@@ ined noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings sub @-@ window can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can damage the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus clean@@ up smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , you may need to change the edge filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter cannot obtain image details and noise or for@@ ging occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak ru@@ ble or JPEG image file without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically more strongly smo@@ ked . however , it also mer@@ ges shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is re@@ acted to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove noise spi@@ kes and is the recommended method for this .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier to shar@@ pen than a picture . to do this , use tools for sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; Edit ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local faults that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping . the texture mapping is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the restoration algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
reduce JPEG arti@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . so you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button finish .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photograph taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the Hot@@ pixel tool allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many JPEG compression cameras have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
upload this file to the wizard with the Dark Picture button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in the connector to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the correct dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and load it automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ quad@@ ratic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; Edit ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise im@@ balance effects occur due to movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and colour or gray scale of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image without this filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation using a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compensate a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a den@@ si@@ fication correction and contrast correction was also performed in the image using this tool .
the &amp; Edit ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree considers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
light : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the pitch or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or res@@ izing changes . it is best to perform this correction as the first one . if you want to cut a picture anew and then perform a tone @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove them with the cro@@ pping tool in the menu Transform@@ ers C@@ utting out of the image processing or via the Zoom Controller of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infr@@ a @-@ red feature of G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org web site , which is accessible via this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters of film gra@@ ined and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gra@@ ined if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of the film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
as the filter mixes colour channels for re@@ producing infrared light , especially the green channel does not make any sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter effect on a landscape photo taken from New Zealand . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the sh@@ akers .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Gra@@ y is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ ined on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ like effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image acqu@@ ires a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photo , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 even though higher values are required . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO 1600 .
the &amp; nbsp ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; Edit ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the smooth@@ ness or , look from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; Edit ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you had chosen to sketch you . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob adju@@ sts the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( fl@@ atten ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; Edit ; Filter Grav@@ ure shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; Edit ; Filter Grav@@ ure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is looked at by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom infin@@ ity : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sporting photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image through accidental displacement of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without alter@@ ing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then re@@ construct it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can choose with the &amp; Edit ; image processing a range free of rain@@ drops . to do this , use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the correct orientation using mirrors or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ate or Transform@@ ers menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . to do this , change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and load are used exactly to do so . each single click for photo magni@@ fy can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button finish .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by magni@@ fying a small picture of the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to use the mouse to create a rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ tangle . you will see this rec@@ tangle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photo is cut away . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . create a new rec@@ tangle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the trimm@@ ing , use the button The C@@ utting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save or File Save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained .
in the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
in the bottom of the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio , it stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimm@@ ed image and not the original image .
the setting help settings allow you to blend assistance so that you can better compose your images . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party organ , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle with similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden partition in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you closer to your destination . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to guide the golden spiral . there should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that , unlike harmonious tri@@ angles , gold tri@@ angles are no indiffer@@ ent tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horizon@@ tal and Ver@@ tical mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the guides . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; Edit ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slide back to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers Zu@@ trunc@@ ation from the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automatic cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new Hei@@ ght : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle at the top left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
corner right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom left : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
corner right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation cro@@ pping from the image processing .
the fixing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal sh@@ earing , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the picture is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by Transform@@ ers Sc@@ iss@@ ors .
check your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you click pres@@ ets , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the control tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the lubrication , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ earing this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two insul@@ ators create twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ earing , the image has blur@@ red tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation cro@@ pping from the image processing .
&amp; Edit ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; Edit .
due to this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; Edit ; shows only files in formats that you know . this happens on the basis of file extension and a comparison of these with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will change &amp; Edit ; you can change this list of file extensions to &amp; digi@@ . in the configuration section you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; Edit ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . this reduces redundant information in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other outcomes than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful guides in English using Wikipedia , The LU@@ MIN@@ O@@ US Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Source File Converter from &amp; digi@@ .
&amp; nbsp ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short movies . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in ways to preview or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; Edit ; the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings for playing movies use to start the program for playback .

many tools you need for photo editing are contained in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise reduction , re@@ focus , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applied quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical split without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper area shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when available .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it down and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to view a square . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de may apply either to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and Hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue palette , you can select from a list of the installed pallets or browse the folders according to files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the palette view . here the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select sel@@ ections . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cursor is activated by Add Color button , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box over@@ writing at Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for clip@@ board data : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line sign if another color follows . if so , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . up to now there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ;

loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems of about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ s pres@@ upp@@ oses . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar only opens the icon file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview appears in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can re@@ open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your selection as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to a page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph .

the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load site gives you the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time .
the Open site allows you to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewers ; you can specify a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or specify that each time you are asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens up further options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Layout algorithms . entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z include :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directional graph@@ s . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ tigen @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ moon timer for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the san@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
when you open the Menu entry Image , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears where you can replace the default values duc@@ r@@ ye own to select your image accordingly . preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka hand@@ book you will find more information .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings might not be shown otherwise .
after pressing the scanning button , you need to wait until the scan is complete and the image file window appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Import menu &gt; screen shot ... a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have picked up the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box displays options of the target image with the options described above .

if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading are changed in size . size is taken from the value entered at Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is modified in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the dialog to be viewed appears then . to perform a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data recorded at the same time in the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the tim@@ e@@ zone . set your camera time zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching dates . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog turns the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the respective region and increase it . always select this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Image Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture to create a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; skill show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all its associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . naturally , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for the thumb@@ nails , these are small pictures that are shown in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program settings to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser will be automatically started at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse frames . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below without the usual loss of quality and metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases because no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in PNG format again .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Digital Camera Client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Digital Camera Client does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please see exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can insert a base image transfer . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ Scan .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that an image will be displayed . the speed of the image transition will be specified below . a lower value creates very sudden , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the generated file can be specified under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can use the coding button to start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly drink a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the jp@@ eg@@ s and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings button on the right .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print out with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters like g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera is in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not have any effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or use them later on , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality wor@@ sens . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it to cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can zoom or enlarge the image . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ press preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . other images can be drag@@ ged to the list of sending images and dropping there .
after you have started the module , the image window will be shown with the images you have selected . you can also add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is shown on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the image list to add them to the list of images to be sent .
using the Del@@ ete button , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just need to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you select are already attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used each time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email .
the PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original files will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages in the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end of the process .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au appears a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you will need to have a graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File name option displays that the filen@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option allows you to display the presentation in an endless loop . you can then manually ab@@ ort it with Es@@ c .
the option Show images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
between the pictures , the temporal distance between the pictures can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar , you can stop and start the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date now has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Back@@ ground Image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo album ; Browse through these , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , locations and in group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images will appear on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on some single images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view them with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the image , each person has the same icon in front of her name . however , you can save your own thumb@@ nail for each person , which of course applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do so , you need to open the picture @-@ picture window ( described in more detail ) and display the entry categories editor in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image should be displayed or truncated .
when you enter the Find entry in the main window , a dialog is displayed to you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog once again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text . if you would like you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names as shown in the picture . here , pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time start , or select the menu entry photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the time bar will always display the current date of the currently displayed images when navig@@ ating in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select a range , you will only be shown pictures of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described , which you can create via the File menu ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each area is described in more detail .
first enter the title of the overview and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo album ; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . see more about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . please note that all images are exported from a party . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why this is not addressed specifically .
on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , resulting in a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the root folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . in order for the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have merged all three to base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder will be created in these , whose name will be specified in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have already spent a great deal of time doing the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you need to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not happen again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file , or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it scans the images that are found in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can ex@@ porting from the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether internal or external .@@ k@@ im files should act . the following three choices are available :
when you copy Man@@ ually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally to copy to .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so anyway , just select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum picture size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... menu , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and watch pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover an image with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your images , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notices the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it in future starts . if you want to read a different database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then you can start another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of your photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will learn the different settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , there is a detailed help available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in this section sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up whole member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a member like in explained .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its into its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be inv@@ oked through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can call about the modules themselves .
since the modules are used together by multiple applications , it may be that modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before applying them to your own images using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I hadn &apos;t warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between the photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications sort their pictures into albums : even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for some modules after albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ating &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album that is simply the current view , so all images that you are viewing the preview right now .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ art album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category people for example , it will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start with your own pictures .
as you can see from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool bar at the top . beneath the toolbar you will see the window with which you have entered your image database . currently , there is not much information , since you have not yet entered information about your images . in this section , we will look back to this window , but click on the entry image to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text field by speci@@ fying people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you type information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the pictures within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , thereby , that the names used are moved up , can find and assign persons more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sort by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail on the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a group . to show you that this is a group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and drag@@ ging the bar that forms the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a box by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... , which among other things offers you the option to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to view this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the item Show images in your browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try again .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
and photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you need to have the pictures saved somewhere , so that you can record the photo album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images showing the upper right corner are not saved on the hard disk . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can preview these images , but you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now , to ask for inser@@ ting the respective CD . so if you want to avoid trouble as the confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures on it .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end those who want to make you accessible to others and click Current View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can see , and lock the menu item All except current view .
this allows you to specify which images in the case of the case should be hidden . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu item Create images , so you can hide all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other hand anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images .
the reason you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours of course is that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course he shows the image , but additional all information you have entered about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed at all . all these options are available right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , find matching entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus respectively minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete screen space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move into the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply draw a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom in again The Plus key zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom spell is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot @-@ key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the Sync button sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out are with the plus and minus key .
with the script from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can see the ab@@ rupt and configuration dialog of the image open to enter this name . however , you will probably prefer to mark the picture and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letters . in the picture you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have placed features on your images , they are available in your browser . so if you have selected all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can simply apply them all at once . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window . if you display categories in the particular preview view , you can add features to the images by simply selecting the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow you to paint photo album ; on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your mean later .
you can see a picture painted on it . to switch on the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; click on the picture to paint from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work , you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the right position :
delete selected objects from the scene with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have modified properties , click Apply to Apply this Chan@@ ges . if you have invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the texture selected . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , check locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the object properties view are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the user to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle will display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views one above the other , you drag the user in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , pull the beginning water on the desktop or click the small to the left pointing arrow in the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... saving . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering Symbol Edit icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene render .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but useful is a name that lets you see the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties which are used by Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . in general , pictures with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling takes the neighboring pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel continues to be divided and adapted because the rec@@ ord@@ able depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are charged by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , R 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
staff of abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are tra@@ cked separately and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er does not support the complete command @-@ set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in paths to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the d@@ ots on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross High detail faithful for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window arrangements . in the section Window ordin@@ ances it is explained how to create and save window arrangements .
drop down sel@@ ector Def@@ ault window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the Exist@@ ing window classi@@ fications list shows all existing window classi@@ fications . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting a selected order with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with the Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ ored the view does not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners is very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should pay attention to the following warnings , before you complain that you will only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have installed all error free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . there@@ with you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click it , you will see the content of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or press the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a straight ( insert infinite body ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the ground if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the horizontal line to the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose offset and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment you select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog where you can select how to insert the object . please select the first object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can review the look of materials at any time with one click . also , there are many possibilities , but take the simplest one now .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you now render your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the object tree you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ och@@ rome and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to perform this step as you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere can be as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor , as you have shifted the ground around a unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , type the ball a pigment as a color :
select First object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing features :
change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome plated surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you can give you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical radi@@ ations from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and broken , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like for example fog work .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered is needed , some sources of light and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back @-@ end .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can modify or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or Es@@ c .
in the Settings - &amp; Cube show , there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; k@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when filling the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start , it opens &amp; balls show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is also filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; merge show ; set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is used to magni@@ fy the display window to the full screen . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der resp@@ . the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; balls show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the entry field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photograph ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides an entry to report problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser opens a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means users and developers are helping each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you may soon be able to answer any questions of other users . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best way to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to join is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ photo ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should be the colors with what you want to display , contrast . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photograph ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; is an application to scan pictures that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan pictures that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; can open a dialog box for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and push OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options in particular .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you select a preview in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save images . open the dialog to save each image , open the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; you want to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder then you need to select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the ... button .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images automatically to be saved and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the # # # character string is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; hand@@ book . the button About launches the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Chann@@ els ; the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; to quit .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cuts . you can set up the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; right mouse button in the player window and select short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this makes your keyboard available to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common features , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scrip@@ ting .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use the k@@ Dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . this usually uses the function ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Listen to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to query more information about the new track ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ als a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le will also pass the path to the selected files in the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry has been cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to perform , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly see the archive as an Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right at the same time .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki Scrip@@ ts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can you never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is the right one for you . and if you still find it hard to decide , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to experience your music anew !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . see the System Requirements section for details .
activates Deb@@ ug@@ ging Symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition , the Player window will turn the player window into the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use the tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able it is compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able it is compiled . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
placing voice files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers will use : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when moving , save the current playlist automatically when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist by ending .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , that the play@@ lists window will roll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible area of the window .
changing to context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section appearance you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s look . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can specify the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn fonts the otherwise grey displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , Player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a font you want from the selection dialog .
with the Select Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection for foreground and background color .
repeat playback at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color spaces will open the color selection dialog . if you do not use your own colors , the default &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the Audio Output tab allows you to select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card .
the Collection Box collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse to music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up , how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse both the checked and their sub@@ folders to music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . also , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under port : the network port under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the load index last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; check a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ teles@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the Met@@ a info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open during a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but do not character@@ ize it as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script solves the problem .

this script requires the per@@ l module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the toolbar effects are easily forgotten . please note that in some cases you need to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : Sni@@ k@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Image , then please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version , or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf in such a way that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or the developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help . please only make a mistake there if you do something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how do pieces of music come into there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively hold the interface , the start sub @-@ window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it in Tools Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist &apos;s title bar and select column rating . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is located . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be : which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( due to patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s as : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( eg . S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS enco@@ des the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server run with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the ar@@ ts@@ Wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ ers , the less dre@@ ge will react to the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . perform the following registry to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download and install ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the registry once again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have stopped by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running title when you are on a different computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ ip d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right button clicks a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returns .

click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N button ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag it to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from the files mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically this fits the previous rating with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the valuation of a piece just as much as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and press : select Review or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term an@@ nex of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok that some users can easily find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the General Settings .

audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . you now have to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok ... add audio output to the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the configuration dialog of x@@ ine now and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check box at sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported any further . of course , you would like to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new urgently needed assistant for arts : )
listen to music should be easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the toolbar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function can also be found in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on one entry and follow the burning menu . you will have various options to burn a CD here .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the packages required are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pleasant .
if you install these packages using a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . however , the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a scroll bar displaying the currently running piece or the current stream . directly below it is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining time of the play .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fiable window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are located below the running text display . the button PL activates or de@@ activates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and change to next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 default settings , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the Main Menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely @-@ developed playlist for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that it does not give in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , the left hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub @-@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information shown there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; also the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and the last time , as well as its rating .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the pieces received are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can specify which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if not yet a text script is running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are sorted according to artist and below them a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your pieces are sorted by genre and then sorted by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works exactly like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you have different time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . you can also select your entire collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in your collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
att@@ aches to a playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to media player - Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player browser section .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in various interpre@@ ters .
und@@ o compilation @-@ selection - Chan@@ ges an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that the album is no longer listed in various interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes dealing with many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
even created Intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to artist , sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive integration for your iPod .
under the toolbar you will find a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there .
if the playlist will last longer than in the window , the holding of files by simple dropping can be difficult . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries to the desired location and dropping them . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries that contain either the one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations with one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist . to the right , you will find Play@@ list , Load Play@@ list , and Rand@@ om@@ ly Mix@@ ers .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar you can find a unique , aug@@ mented analy@@ zer . the rate of refres@@ her can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button on the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you will get in the player window by right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example , playback wheels and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and selecting toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . additionally , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . you can use this menu to access &amp; Amar@@ ok settings .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry hides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start them by selecting Ac@@ tions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from :
the queue management received your big entry into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
the administration of the queue allows you to open a queue management tool . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the sequence of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ specified ( the details of the installation of these play@@ lists ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces already exist in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one .
the two pres@@ et modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately complete your playlist and you can directly start playing . the recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , select the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New button initi@@ ates the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist means you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed in accordance with the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , then the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want .
some scripts have their own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . a drop @-@ down dialog will open in which a script package will be installed . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . simply select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to Scrip@@ ts writing .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used to enable the available visualization in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that you will receive a more inferior quality when you re @-@ encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . wait until the computer finishes the burning process .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all the k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as reading the original in the image file is complete , you will be prompted for an empty CD @-@ medium on which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules can not be found . to fix this problem , launch q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get news from the forums .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least a k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD tracks in a run @-@ through ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; has all the functions , also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; to burn CDs . in some cases &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio Enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ V@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . it can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that tunes the music pieces differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . once the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filen@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown where you can select folders and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can then choose between saving and modi@@ fying . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what to do with it as if you had called closing for each project file C@@ lose .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called File C@@ lose .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it promp@@ ts &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you put files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used .
this entry only appears on an active Data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files .
open the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not supported yet , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , thus the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes super@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the Content View , but can also be used stand@@ alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include the properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be shown in the Content View . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and locks of the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view also allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ board is a narrow@@ er area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the keyboard assignment .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and type of task is crucial , which of the included programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
void copy@@ .d@@ v@@ d ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ .d@@ v@@ d ( ) void auto@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( ) void auto@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can generate a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ fo@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ For@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ res@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string parent ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ name ) void set@@ Volume ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ der bar / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio Creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; Audio Creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ded these wa@@ v files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ builder ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer provides a small introduction about encoder , audio quality , and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any proprietary audio CD ; just avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up must be done only once ( but the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this ( hopefully ) leads to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can fetch informations from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the step by step example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
start the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD data according to the device &apos;s request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup ples - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read from a different encoder than the default . it must be noted that before the encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file will be selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ Wizard ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as Enco@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices exists .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices generally only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et media &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and self @-@ co@@ ilers . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to file size then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the encoder explains the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; to add title to the keywords ( English : day ) when enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title Par@@ ameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ noon must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ IDE ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / write audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering into the host . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the Pi@@ eces , etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; is active a check box to select ( Send an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; Audio Creator ; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally located mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save to WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the encoder and the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , there are predefined values for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ zer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder .
this can have many causes . check device name of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive that is installed on both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something inside the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; , something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what should be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with which fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the box CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; it is associated with low risk , if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries resulting from it , it can easily be changed . the directory or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed among the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both work exactly as far as the server is concerned , but as many fire@@ walls are bo@@ oting the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the protocol is usually open to surf on the internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
numbers at the same time : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try themselves .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this box to check out the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you click this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . if you do not want to make this folder , if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right in order to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the --@@ id@@ 3 v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously encoding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tempted to code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ noon ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is established , because we want to pick up data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted in the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , search the Questions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives , a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment field below can be used for individual comments , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ builder ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoding settings tab ; have a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding / file formats . see the Help for the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the output CD ; in this example this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the tracks that are selected will be read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All Parts button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click on the selection button to read the selection process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first part is just read on the disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message when trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed . items that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we &apos;ve entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ noon ; today , if you know CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ noon . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , if it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various index cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after starting the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? anyone reading this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot keep this manual up . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ visu@@ al@@ . anyone who wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Car@@ aoke Player of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others it has with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and CI@@ S cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button on the toolbar , select the pick @-@ up from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and thus change the playing speed . to get back to the original tempo , double @-@ click on the template LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text inclin@@ ation , others use lyrics and again both . some pieces have no lyrics at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust what events should be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song so that you do not need to manually set up automatic text selection , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify a type of event , select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played in the series . in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ izing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection is not saved . remember if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when automatic adding to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that continue to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next song button , record next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to return a song back , select the preceding piece button , the item Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI map compil@@ es general MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet if a piano was originally played .
if you only have one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary implem@@ entations for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you can see that default is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun , for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file should play a touch with Patch 127 ( kick shot ) , it will take Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and play the sound 60 regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant that each note is a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one at which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how notes are m@@ apped onto a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
the key@@ maps are used above all to map tones to the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . look as an example of the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword will be used with the name name for this channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is where pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no decim@@ al comm@@ as .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which gets a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a ton higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a drop down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played sounds . view in the Settings menu under the Point channel view : settings
the speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the left and right arrows from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; that allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to produce very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
OK , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first of all , enable Automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the temporary files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the Automati@@ cally adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ B. , B.@@ B. and C.@@ mi@@ d. First you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally adding to the collection and open A.@@ M. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then choose to play B.@@ S@@ mid and X@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , I encourage me to write on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; in the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an enhancement of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me happy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and managed by no one for it . I would therefore like to emphasize that I only use programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the CI@@ S support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc De@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error alert or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , it can be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid , with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music .
if you encounter any problems , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is available in it .
it is possible to save favorite links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; recent pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; KM@@ Player ; you can simply click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and see next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part will be shown .
after changing XML files , select the play@@ lists from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
animation on starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ ME ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end of the animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; supported .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another tool for troubleshooting is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ sole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button in the tool bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; S@@ ME ; to play the &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash must be specified in the configuration dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or oder &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be used in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( View , Con@@ sole , or Con@@ sole from the context menu ) .
thus always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ ME ; can play from TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player dialog is to be used in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be found ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , different names are used by S@@ ME for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
are there hints as to how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be run as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom moun@@ ts on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does every time my CPU have to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for the creation of graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; manage .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to apply to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the Ki@@ le ; website .
if you have any questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; Ki@@ le provides the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ;
for &amp; latex ; is the proper language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a lay@@ man ( close lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it is derived from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview about &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to master &amp; latex ; properly master , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
as well as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; latex ; an introduction to which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ es are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and has to be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , a book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
coding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; latex ; for the incorpor@@ ation they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Buch ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ones ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
when setting up a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le , an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) is automatically generated by setting a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ category the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking the respective button .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when selecting your own . once a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the commercial output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the reverse search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked becomes the exact opposite of it . as soon as one cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; latex ; source text , the corresponding position is j@@ umped in the DVI ; Viewer .
master Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set via Project Properties .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is referred to as a part of the tool@@ box , and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast integration of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ instructions for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , joints or references . the available options are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection above a selection box possible ) .
using quote will display a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; works this only if the file is going to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size . it can be used to define the font sizes for the main text , the joints , etc . the following types of text are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and st@@ acking the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12 pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also occur later in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or but@@ ton@@ â s quick construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; execute the storage automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , you should look for the errors in the logging process . if you are using a quick build &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created , and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } may be added as a part of the community .
the changes are only caused within the environment ( by \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , there may be certain fonts , bold prints , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; -@@ mark@@ up language is represented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . for this , at least one quotation , a few passages in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem should come to see the differences in these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl @-@ E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ i output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the preference search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; files . to do this , simply set up Modern under Settings box ... Building tools must be selected .
to perform the preference search , the poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the corresponding position in DVI ; the viewer is then made .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; insert &amp; box ; open and jump to the appropriate line . for this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; specified as text editor ( Set@@ ting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if you do not want to open the &amp; DVI Extender function , an error can be found . if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window in summary .
the logging file tells the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can use the previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and the worst La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the faulty line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the defective line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button on the toolbar , a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
hands @-@ on users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in &amp; Ki@@ le to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template ...
when creating a new document from a new document using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... settings General settings .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created . if an easy way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below will be searched .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked via the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use and its syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip is only \ \ par .
when drag@@ ging the text with left mouse button pressed , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most varied types of source contexts and to emphasize these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . it is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the men@@ tions edit jumps or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . thereby , this jump @-@ mark is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent opportunities offered , were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text added . &amp; latex ; special instructions for their selection . under Edit Sty@@ les the following commands are included for selection of text :
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with transparent lines ( like in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only point in this case is that the Ab@@ yss@@ tz@@ e are separated by two empty lines .
select the word in the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command will also include &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to allow a part of the document , it can be checked at first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Removal , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to edit paragraph he@@ el .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the surrounding area .
if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the best view can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clasp .
if the cursor is in front or behind the sharpen@@ ed clip of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , j@@ umped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups bra@@ ces , the best view can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened group , so the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as a bott@@ len@@ eck . for the practical implementation it is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple reference marks . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and includes two closing signs for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic insertion of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
custom settings ( e.g. German or French ) and therefore German or French accents can also be used . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting Shift ; Enter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a closing line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ; added to La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to inv@@ ent this . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator is unfortunately not the added , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been expanded in &amp; Ki@@ le ; three different modes ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) have been added . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings Box ... complete .
at the beginning of a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } will &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back key , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to gr@@ ind down the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can also be used , so that a jump to these positions can be possible by working jumping brand N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ sten jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be used .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set@@ ting up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . there can be various items lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ per books of the general language used .
the command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the inv@@ ocation mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the surroundings are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environment .
when invo@@ king the fully @-@ quit environment or key key Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically inserted into the environment and it will appear \ \ begin . after that , the ambient effect can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of sections that are replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of a subscription list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word assignment mode is initiated via the menu editor or pressing C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large washers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many more users are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le provides the complete support for all previously written questionn@@ aires .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... Ki@@ le can be dep@@ rec@@ ated . here also the tres@@ hold for displaying the completion can be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode is available for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog displays graphics as simple as possible . in order to view the basics about the graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for the changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to be able to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed in the menu Create compile , create conversion , and create views .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used to the single Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer with Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project is being asked about the Project New Project .... The following information is being asked for the project :

the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can change in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts is in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a fairly sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; &amp; &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; latex ; reference .
a complete Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its part @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art circle of friends . this is not only a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contained and is thus ideal for the search for a specific format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ tur@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the &amp; Ki@@ le ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the larger advantage is the search for package names or folders . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer to the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be installed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , making &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with command @-@ line interface you create random signatures or signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is read from &amp; k@@ sig ; read by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for day signatures the same signature is read from &amp; k@@ sig &apos;s signature file throughout the day . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the signature tab . if you have entered your signature , save it by typing C@@ trl ; S File Save or click the Save button .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you are using e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross Remove in the toolbar .
open the short@@ cut dialog . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ not ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has known opinion and how outstanding it is . if we take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ u in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ s is located in a busy working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time mine is started .
as I said before , anyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ u , it is easy to select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ u is found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then let the current file be cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check option .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and enter the location of &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG revision is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; required in the file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have been named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sp@@ ends , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the menu Plugins Edit . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins is used without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and clicking the S@@ etze as a button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after which they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
notes to be entered is simple . either the note -@@ entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comments text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the introduced nick@@ name of the team member , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities :
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including auto completion can be changed with this .
large / Small @-@ notation of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
automatically update the start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatically replacing acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by using the Def@@ ault button , the default settings can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file Open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting here is st@@ alled by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . this setting here , however , is eliminated from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly , so that in a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next launch of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . even for un@@ saved documents a backup will be created regularly , according to the set time .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
reset the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come across by changing M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / hanging views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages section is used for controlling the possibility of switching off warning messages by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL@@ Cs and the source text view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set in details .
in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action sol@@ dered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the tree &apos;s update frequency when editing and how deep is to be opened automatically when changing the structure tree . empty knots are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the area for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that will un@@ fold when editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid batch for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path to the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in the &quot; read @-@ only mode &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in den@@ ies the load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the information entered is correct , then the plugin can also be saved if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , which adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector can be used to change the specific settings .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view showing the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not need to be taken care of .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or stops listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug@@ ging request has been started , the script will start with the request .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution goes on . if it happens before a de@@ bug@@ ging request is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help you get better .
document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool bars . tag folders contain two file types , the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbol @-@ oriented bodies of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which can insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how to create tag XML files , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day indicates . the file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a type@@ writer .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
valid only for the method method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that &apos;s a single element type element .
specifies an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling for attributes in tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for a attribute description . it is a merely element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( i.e. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just @-@ element type .
all tag XML files must start with an XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the tag XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not yet available . currently , the check takes place only when you load the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag@@ XML file . this file describes a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function . the filen@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &lt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; name &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD @-@ editing D@@ TD settings . with this di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a select &amp; D@@ TE@@ P file ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . clicking New Action leads to the same dialog :
button short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the user @-@ defined button can be used to assign a keyboard short@@ cut ; K@@ einer is the current key short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in the event of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input , you can specify what to send to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the standard output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the output field output :
when there are many tags in mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the check@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ w@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphic Other Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually seen as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ day in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the icon , it must still be joined with the action . this happens through the menu with settings to set actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags if there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool bar to set dialog about Settings tool bars . make sure the required toolbar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup to the correct folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most not@@ orious extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the script language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository to check if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation now ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it for yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contexts separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a financial contribution we recommend to sign the resources for what it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this guarantees the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your private g@@ p@@ g key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can choose one . in the Create New Resource you will need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click on OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scrip@@ ting tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format . there is the simpler way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD store and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target Directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Definition line : the string that should appear in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , sp@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adjusted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is selected as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related items are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the project folder tree , which em@@ bl@@ ys the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the tabs with information and the tool bars . please hit in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all file tabs , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , skip to a book@@ mark or execute CVS instructions on the current document .
right @-@ click on the editing pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor , or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window , the tool bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , for example , &amp; lt ; then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this straight inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the construction supervis@@ ors ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open them and strip them . in the representation with tabs are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done with the contex@@ tual menu that appears .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available script languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking on an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development to find . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensively reinforced and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar Archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up languages editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why Development , what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to utilize an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ a Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script outputs error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of the script and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
start and turn the problem report at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter will be activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar at the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find the details explained .
load a project tool bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions need to be set by means of settings ... added . tool bars are saved by toolbar buttons , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
loading one &amp; D@@ TD ; that made you or someone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P need to be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a standard sub@@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current Tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub @-@ menus .
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the insertion is denied by tool bar if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above menu items . click on it . click an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activates it .
select syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ ending identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries the switch may sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically after filling out the project name . all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on setting the remote host an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
check if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of OK .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the hooks , cli@@ pping out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . in the Project Properties menu , these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or changed using Shift + F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , will be excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
up@@ loading profiles can be uploaded to upload profiles ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by cont@@ acting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the Team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , modify or delete events . event actions will be executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be affected at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project Menu or the Project Open Project from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are as well , however the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu that can be activated with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is f@@ aded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programs . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk saving option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar Project tool bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars are stack@@ able in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to design via the menu tool bars . use and addition differ . adding tool bars is handled below in the section Add toolbar buttons .
tool bars and symbols can be set using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) in which new action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions such as tool bar , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up Tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set settings ..
templates are in essence document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates as basic as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you choose for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents by short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the template tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more special documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and arran@@ ges the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted into the documents again and again . you can contain everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save as Local template ....
once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save Sel@@ ection as Local / Project Tem@@ plate . alternatively , the selection can be drawn easily with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can use all file management functions for it , such as drag@@ ging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create site template , enter a name for the template and save it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ press head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described previously ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden as soon as par@@ ental attributes are verb@@ alized .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template table . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly activated . if nothing appears , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows for previous or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to add content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , by using the context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) , you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ dependen@@ cy of &amp; PHP ; -@@ Source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , the key pressure moves the active cursor from one window to the other , while the position is maintained in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be set up using Qu@@ anta settings .... Choice of V@@ PL ; -@@ view can be selected between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted in addition : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it &apos;s possible to choose document properties . thus editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows the change of the content , e.g. key words on the name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is not supported at this time .
it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible , as in word processing , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . the marking functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing in and by means of a return button or reset button .
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way over the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other tag should be removed .
some toolbar buttons such as the spread@@ sheet assistant or the list assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , you need the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries that are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;
hold in a template , at a point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned re@@ taining points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without a path name . file names in the same folder as the up@@ loading file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
this command checks for a partial or entire agreement with a for@@ age named QNAP or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any of the my@@ ME file that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ ME &quot; is extended to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; expanded to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a rag@@ ged stopping point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this will be executed automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

output &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ; free ; ( In &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ; may only be used the file : / / protocol . this will be converted into a correct file name for the operating system )
if a value is specified for the &quot; search@@ results t@@ sp@@ ath &quot; option , all the output files are stored in this folder . otherwise search@@ results .x@@ ml will be processed by search@@ .x@@ s@@ l , search@@ ht@@ m@@ l@@ .x@@ s@@ l is used with the option &quot; pre@@ fre@@ html . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file named search@@ results .x@@ ml will be created . this file can then be edited with a custom style template to display the data in other form , If the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prefer@@ html &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not set , the search@@ results file is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the amount of data to be processed , the execution of this command may take some time .

&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a de@@ bug@@ ging program in X@@ SL style sheets ( X@@ SL = e@@ X@@ ten@@ sible St@@ yl@@ es@@ he@@ et Language ) . &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; has similar commands like the Unix / Linux de@@ bu@@ gger g@@ db . there are three ways to perform a style sheet :
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g --@@ shell --@@ cd &amp; lt ; --@@ par@@ am ; --@@ par@@ am &amp; lt ; --@@ long &amp; lt ; --@@ long &amp; lt ; --@@ long &amp; lt ; --@@ -@@ --@@ verb@@ ose ; --@@ revision --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ -@@ code --@@ -@@ x@@ include --@@ revision --@@ st@@ d@@ out --@@ autor@@ es@@ art + X@@ SL@@ Source + X@@ ML@@ Data
&quot; &quot; &quot; start a shell . then enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get an overview of the help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds the parameter named &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on the command &quot; add@@ res@@ am &quot;
exec@@ utes the conversion 20 times when --@@ repeat is twice @-@ specified , the conversion will be executed 100 times
the input data are treated as HTML files if the support is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml
activates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document when the support for it has been enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default
on systems with the re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can scroll through the cursor keys to the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to give composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
filen@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems .
path : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or XML _ document processed by the style sheet . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;
running time commands : &lt; bye _ BA@@ R _ exit _ quit } , step , step @-@ up , step down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options
there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it into one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was to compare and merge folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge will be fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the merge @-@ Editor under the differences window allows you to solve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check codes , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tabs are displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anger when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 k@@ imper@@ 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the Open dialog allows for manual typing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog registers your selection and displays them again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
using the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the compare / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog you do not need to select files , you can close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files first , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can easily copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment you can do nothing out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; pull out only the dropping of text into a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Each info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can see at the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not as important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is displayed dotted lines .
the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the title edition : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text already , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows , where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing there is no more line left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; There is only one plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy this text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the image scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also be used by other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Con@@ version section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Image In@@ side / Str@@ g @-@ Image Ab@@ reverse ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , the clip@@ board is automatically copied and the manual copying is dropped . however , be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a new@@ line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered to@@ ast@@ ert . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically set an un@@ filled color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted at pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line is also automatically used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . no manual copying to the clip@@ board then is om@@ itted .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . in this step white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a new@@ line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the carriage returns are made visible , although they are treated differently . when this option is checked , this option must be disabled . during the merge , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , the numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
looking inten@@ sely after even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in the auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
this is useful when white characters are used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the option Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflict from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are covered in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you have to start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for the encoding , a short note appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to use for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color @-@ co@@ ded overview column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be shown next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is also specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at the end of the line . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this pre @-@ comp@@ iling command for line calibration to convert the input to capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ ) \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a cum@@ ulative expression that fits all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the translation string will refer to the found text in the first pair of brackets . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ Key@@ word generated text $ . therefore , a pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation is needed . the \ \ before the $ is necessary because $ is a special character and would mean the end of the line .
while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from one another . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / ZIP &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations will only change the data that the line @-@ like algorithm will see .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line processor will see the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... sel@@ ects selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you just need to open folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
when three folders are merged , then folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while entering the folder , a small message window informs about the current progress . if you cancel scanning the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown together . you can fold a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the item or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions , and all sub@@ directories are opened with which you can open or fold all the folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed again about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is green , then yellow and later when it is old , turns red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that after that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) is enabled , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the same date is identical .. As long as the files are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file will be processed after another . you indicate status column when mer@@ ging was successful , and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode , B will be used as a destination , B will be chosen as the destination and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as a destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current record : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Options Per@@ missions , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are ready with a file , select another folder merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , then a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue ; his work will continue with the next entry .
when you commit to a bug , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to issue the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can try again to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding to merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set@@ ting up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the Element@@ tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders matching this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders matching this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ matic generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be shown in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
if the option is turned off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that the link contains a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled by default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is disabled by default .
activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected so that after that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled by default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the folder merge view is visible during the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch off the window divi@@ der with the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the folder &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be saved to replace and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge .
this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters have to be mas@@ ked ( # - &gt; % 23 , spac@@ e- &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit permissions or change dates . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ dence of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Sli@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to recover the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ user Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called Kom@@ pare ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by st@@ rolling in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go that way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably not notified the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters varies , these lines are treated as iden@@ tically , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines will be next to each other , this term is defin@@ dence but this is more often the case .
the editor will notice every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort required for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; published and the text can not be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copy to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . paste ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the update folder after changes to these options . )
there will only be entries showing differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and applications running therein . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in addition , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimum , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Be@@ en .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is checked , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ tops are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the windows with its standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be specified : classi@@ cally lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical line , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog yet , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and assign a value to this file . possible values are :
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can enlarge a part of the screen as if you read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a select window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you may &amp; k@@ mag ; to do this , a selected screen area can be displayed in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cursor to be displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note , that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or use the &amp; M@@ MB file , you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your pres@@ et short@@ cuts for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ads ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and reducing &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it &apos;s a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a screen magni@@ fier , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .
for more detailed user documentation , please use help : / k@@ mag ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or launch k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays on the same spot for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and that every mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse @-@ click causes pain . moreover , it can em@@ ulate drag@@ ging with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer , if this is not yet done .
to clarify : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and , as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
the smart moving is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can execute the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before the k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click passes .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait until it starts the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place .
this function activates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and click here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last press is pressed .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent delay .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually rather simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as it happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent delay in this case , this means that you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution to this problem is that you run a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it . however , park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , a accidentally move can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent delay , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible in this way to mark text , copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action at which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some ad@@ vices for this :
do not use the smart move if you just start using the k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead : run a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when smart moving the shift time starts . later , you can use the intelligent delay even without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to be pressed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag@@ ging and dropping can also be done with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ts@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a program that allows silent users to let their computers speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer talk for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be re @-@ spoken .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . see the description of the setup dialog for more details .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text pass@@ books you can choose often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the wor@@ ter@@ ing@@ . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can match the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word tran@@ scription .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a continuous memory of the spoken movements ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have done mouth ; properly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . any spoken sentence is attached to the outlet . you can select sets that are to be spoken once again .
with the Settings menu entry , mouth ; set up ... open the preferences dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the site wor@@ d@@ ge@@ ography , as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the box of the box speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box under the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed to the language generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as standard input . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . see the app@@ endi@@ x for examples .
if it is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ac@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a passage passage in the Text passage script or in the bar for text pass@@ books .
with the selection of Im@@ medi@@ ately speaking , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the main memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected text passage is entered first only into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box C@@ lose the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book is to be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ book save the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ als page contains a list of Wor@@ ter@@ ers dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply calculated by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add only properly written words to the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting them in the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ul@@ sion storage .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool bar is located directly under the menu bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another position .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with hints about the condition of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text pass@@ books with entries . the paste is arranged by default above the editing pane directly below the tool bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another position .
probably you did not enter the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up Settings ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the voice card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for Voice Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use festival free of charge and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett directory . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax like to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to make use of , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ts@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an application that allows people who cannot speak text can be sent by the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is saved , which the user can always spend again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that there is no voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

before you can use it , you need to install and set the program of speech tools . see also
on the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card board will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the General tab will be shown .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up several versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use it ; because the program speed @-@ dispat@@ cher uses the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the index tabs Spo@@ k@@ es@@ man in kt@@ m@@ gr , the card board is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and no speaker has yet been set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers are listed above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with one mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with one mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to push the speaker in the list down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the Spo@@ k@@ es@@ person . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; click on the map for orders to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language sharing system ; click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; t@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card map will display orders and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ m@@ gr is terminated , is running &amp; kt@@ ops ; continue , if the Voice Output box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the Control Panel &apos;s system range , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete .
with buttons in this row you can start , stop , pause and resume text jobs .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; copy the clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the Card Or@@ ders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and select En@@ able Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; t@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check if &amp; t@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
notification is the &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you of events that you specified . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; convers@@ ational ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different kinds of messages . for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; t@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by e @-@ mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech tool . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace fal@@ sely spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain defici@@ encies of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ en@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the output of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; - Noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . any order you send from the card card is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such reading , this issue is stopped and ended .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to screen readers &apos; output . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be more types of filters .
substitute symbols replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ats ; is provided with predefined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ reform@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
with voice selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the voice card spokes@@ man , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . let &apos;s read about it .
each filter has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; - Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters that were set up on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not enabled and will not be used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the subsequent installation di@@ alogs will be displayed below .
for the set @-@ up of string replacement filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name at will , you just have to distinguish yourself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed from top to bottom in the displayed sequence .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ id @-@ running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter copy .
the string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions with an entry in the box do apply a filter if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ator characters .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can view it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions . den &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package c@@ equi@@ li@@ ls .
XML ; translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the voice selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card reader , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that the texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program sends , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; with the speaker output filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try anch@@ oring the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which is best suited to the requirements you want . click the button to the right to show the dialog for subscri@@ ber selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the voice selection filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Apply filter if applicable . you have to enter at least one condition .
the language edition API , from &amp; k@@ de ; that programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the voice syn@@ thesizer , makes it possible to use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the Language Edition API from &amp; k@@ de ; The complete documentation for both APIs is found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech to .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; console ; window . start kt@@ st@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ reform@@ ers filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does work at all . you must also do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter .

the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to expand it , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; t@@ p , you need a K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) development environment , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the &quot; speech @-@ dispat@@ cher &quot; program files .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source code archive for downloading and downloading the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using it , first check if the speech syn@@ thesizer is working properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech disp@@ en@@ sers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can leave the pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph style , repeat , pause or stop output .
if an application passes text to &amp; t@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about it , select a speaker , look in .
if you click on the tab Spo@@ k@@ es@@ man on Add button , and thus insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the Box Spo@@ k@@ es@@ person setup will be shown . see below for details of the module for Festival Interactive .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is contained in PAT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text passed at the festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech rate and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this grey , the voice you select does not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker or click Apply .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of kt@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text , so you have the possibility to read or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card reader .
with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ m@@ gr becomes the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text jobs are listed and managed here . screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the types of news from &amp; t@@ ts , see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was created &amp; t@@ t@@ ts ; either compiled or edited without support for the appropriate audio module ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the unit speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % corresponds to about half and 200 . % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; des@@ kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after reading the screen reader , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file will be played whenever a normal text order is interrupted . if both the sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the sound will be played before the incoming message .
the settings on this tab only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read the Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the notification card will appear .
check this check box to enable read &amp; k@@ de preview ; if this setting is un@@ checked , the rest of the settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ t@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications , where a sound is played , will be played by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read before .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event that you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the conversation , sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops ;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what is to be done when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is shown in the list on the map speaker as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the notification settings as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the notification to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . moreover , brands are part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival uses in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ ms ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds are subject to text in single movements . this means that only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also skip or stop orders on the map card , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the set border detection filter . at the first start of &amp; t@@ p , a set limit acknowled@@ gement filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker &apos;s selection . turn off the speaker selection and select text for reading . check out the unit selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can take a long time ,
you can then pause or ab@@ ort text orders on the map card even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set border detection filter will be set up automatically if you start kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and insert a tab@@ ulation mark ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set border detection filter maintains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set border detection filter from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; t@@ ts .
on the card reader selection , you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select the speaker . otherwise , select the speaker . otherwise , select the speaker .
select the method to enter the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language lies before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the range speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector and then use the speaker that matches the following below .
in this case 0 is available for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes instantly when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get track@@ back .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ops ; you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . in case of G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 is installed . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time . when I receive a text order , it freezes &amp; t@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ d / vocals . when this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , send it to the developer .
on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card for subscri@@ ber setup . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) disable either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ hap@@ ing filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file acc@@ uses to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added a custom string replacement filter and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more by default or back . on the tab orders will be displayed , the job consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you are not allowed to filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for punc@@ ture border detection instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the default register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ teles@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; freezes if you stop a text order and then launch another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with July 2005 a@@ Co@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will be read before .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already .
have you downloaded and downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime @-@ dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . the configure column configure option to turn off the creation shows the configure parameter that causes the creation of the creation .
default is &amp; t@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example

before using it , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , Festival is the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ® syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; produces the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a full voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found at .
in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be controlled in a desk ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be inv@@ oked by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings is displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured func@@ tionally , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll , which displays the device at all and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up for installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by matching the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this is attempted to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release status . by selecting non @-@ again questions the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . by clicking on the button system management mode , you will get to the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available , divided into three tabs :
the Network Inter@@ faces tab is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed .
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button &apos; interface &apos; ... in the dialog box set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
the TCP / IP configuration can be set with the option manual without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the IP address input field .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . switching on a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
network devices can be enabled or disabled , depending on your needs . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface needs to be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address like about 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons behind or below in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... the Edit dialog will be shown .
the list name commonly known calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list includes named hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP , which is still in the test , should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known host has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Know@@ ing Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately operative in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a GUI can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are required .
this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ a.@@ The following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technique will be given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; change configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IPv@@ 6 has never found a large spread . IPv@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . therefore , IPv@@ 6 is expected to focus on IPv@@ 4 , which is widespread in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in other networks , on the &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point that sends a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so their arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if any other content is found there than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another state than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar which also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a band can be used it must be included in &amp; dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat ; R@@ ST the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing device on the tape does not know , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing device , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was inserted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps out the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be thrown out without any danger .
before a tape of &amp; dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . floppy drives usually prec@@ ede a format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives however do not .
after entering the band name and capacity &amp; dat , proceed with format@@ ting the tape . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically included and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the Backup dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the test has been started , the dialog will appear for Veri@@ fication . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the verification settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored have to be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the Settings dialog will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file based on the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two ways from the band New :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all the folders that are listed under backup files , only the files located therein will be backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar separately from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then have been backed up .
the name of the file used to identify changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . on some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing &amp; K@@ dat , it is automatically dis@@ car@@ ded . do not use this option on floppy disks .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to report the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat ; format@@ ted a tape , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for sy@@ slo@@ g server format and sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system log - will open . it will not be displayed to you , and it will open up instead of its a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator rights . the log files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for which normal users usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string . to do this , enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines is now changed automatically , so that only the log lines are displayed next to the filter . then a log line is only displayed if the string of the filter keyword is contained in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter @-@ search term will be matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol @-@ file system log , select the process name , and also add the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar ; this will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the Level Er@@ r@@ ors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than minutes lines of the Level Note . the color display of protocol lines can be switched on setup dialog .
if you only want to show specific processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can display the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the To New Lines option in the main window context menu to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a Protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ esystem log ; also , you &apos;ll find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for program start @-@ up when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to System V In@@ it without ne@@ eding a new installation and reform@@ at@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you would like to start when bo@@ oting the system or switching to another Run@@ level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are based on r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when bo@@ oting .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the beginning range a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you will fix it by re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably will see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition I could also have a user runtime , the &amp; eg ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( resp@@ . stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ time or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area . to copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the destination area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target zone of the action .
the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sort numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to enable the different working ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard @-@ run @-@ level@@ n , and now the machine constantly re@@ starts . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt in lin@@ ux single and press the Enter key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for run under Run@@ level X but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution , please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that they can be attached to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either you can use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In menu item .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created where you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards will appear if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the Pass Password Management appears if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD univers@@ es .
this card only appears if space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one mounted file system ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space limitations each in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with plac@@ eholder constra@@ int
the tab groups informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , you will find in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu User or Group or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
