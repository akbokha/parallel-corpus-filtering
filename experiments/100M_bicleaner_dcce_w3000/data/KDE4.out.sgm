<seg id="1">To translate the module website, please refer to the & konqueror; menu on Tools website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations do not make important decisions dependent without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier to access.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; select Setting Extensions.... Open the toolbox Tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings modules from the kde; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may need more modules on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & Conqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module pin filter (also called the folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools Angle Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; the current working directory can be filtered in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView is to map nested folder hierarchies by means of a so-called tree map. tree-Maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can display either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or mapping of a different file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it will be displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of child rectangles should be used (and thus, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">In the display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of the entries, and these frames require space, which is then no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the space of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive duplicates.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally shown area for an entry using the menu entry View. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a child entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the use of Cachegra.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Tools Picture Gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Image Gallery module, a dialog opens with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Pictures per line option has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box File name of the image, specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery below the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the check box image size indicate whether the size of the images below the thumbnails is displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save to HTML file, specify where the HTML page should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set up with a slider or a rotating field to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the Candidate Commentary file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box You can specify a different color depth than in the original pictures for the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu in the Navigation Pane window or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror's navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror where you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses access with this browser, change the browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are correctly represented with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">By menu entry... you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; -Style templates and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You can check the module website in the & konqueror; menu on Tools website. you can make the following checks:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check, test if your & HTML; document of the syntax of & HTML; matches all found errors will be displayed. with this test, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style templates that are embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a uniform appearance independent of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your page for forwarding and faulty connections. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you can set the addresses of the server for the verification of your & HTML; documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module web-archive for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .was format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on Tools website with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy to use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. of course, any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& Edit; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in the 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as the camera or the lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& nbsp; attempts to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry to report problems or desires.... This opens a dialog with a broken link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& nbsp; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developers will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to encourage you to join the user's mailinglist of & digikam; in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digibox; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam;</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved in & digikam; to participate, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & Edit; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder here. just enter path names or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data reconciliation is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & Edit; will you additionally use as an Albenlibrary. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & Edit; looks at each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. during browsing the folder you will get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& Edit; durst recursively defaults the library path in its entirety. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this can be done by adding a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change it by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can in & Edit; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Reporting Tool to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can work as well; possibly handle it. the support is based on the libraw-library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in the Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. of course, any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often registered as a disk drive. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivates. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses gphoto2 to communicate with digital camera as. gphoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is meanwhile obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 needs to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be reliably read by digiKam. if the if support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digitised is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is a joint module structure for & digikam; to develop KPhotoAlbum, Showigs and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & Edit; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digicame; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping images works everywhere: you can put a picture in another part of the tree, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only constraint is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter on the filename only works when this ind icon view is also displayed. which fields are displayed, you can configure the settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos taken by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was created first.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. to do this, select album Import Photos. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Import screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos. if you want to add or delete new collections Up collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums Following date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first select an album in & Edit; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteeper. this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& nbsp; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be shown in this album in the image window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can customize the size of these preview using the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a bit while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using all preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be shown below the appropriate preview. what information is this, you can edit via Settings; modify the albums page and customize the thumbnails section to suit your needs.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the cursor a moment over an image. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that is about & digitized; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can access all the features with & Edit; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either the F4 Picture... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit.... in the Edit section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image editing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& Edit; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the thumbnail with the right mouse button and select turning. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 to rename from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & Edit; delete it, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Del Case you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My date slips; organizes your photos using the data. & Edit; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the View View. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos that have been selected using this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also locate parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lignment; to fold, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned cue in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so, you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported in the loss of the database once & after; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either to & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select Create New keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, it will become the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears, which gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the keyword name and the icon in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select as a nightmare preview in the pop-up menu. in addition, you can drag the picture to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To make use of the functionality with keywords, first you need to apply your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the pictures you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword alerts from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can specify a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword to each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have given a picture with keywords, it will appear below the thumbnail in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you click with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photos and select from the Tags menu Remove. the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a chronogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all database elements: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps, and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to this search box is a small lamp that will be green if the search hits matches. if you click here, the filtering will be cleared and all images will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you will get a simple search box like the one described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the header OK and the search is done. the results are used in the View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your search again, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select Search, the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information previously entered. if you select Edit as advanced search, the dialog for Advanced search appears to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching. more information can be found in the Advanced Search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete Search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. an option can be added to this list with search group / delete search group. any option can be linked to others over the logical operations All..., A..., No... or at least... or at least.... furthermore, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar items: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. by using a sponge the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & Edit; finds the matching images. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it down and move it. move it while you click the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to view a square. this assumes, of course, that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Following the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window will be opened. if you are back in & Edit; main window, you can quickly open the luminous table with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you can select the preview from the toolbar and execute Zoo or Vershooting operations on one of the images, you can also compare them to the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited for fast sorting out of a series of images. if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the left pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available in the light table for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivelling feature, which you recognize on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the picture, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; in the Preview mode both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works exactly as in other views. simply use the zoom control below the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos capture, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We provide you with a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, protect, protect and use photos. we focus on downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, securing, evaluating, reporting, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes on, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. according to your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find a specific photo no longer without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digitise;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you maintain anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. note that you will need to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, e.g. versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. disconnect new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata store option to be stored in & digitized in the settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts as you should assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to every photo. of course, you can select all the images that the same attribute may need and then set the value. it makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's continue with keywords, keywords, as you often refer to other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. converting the tree within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated while the subtree tracks.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let most people see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you're sure to get in touch with your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream of having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. thus, the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him about the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & Edit; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you a spell checker. if you export your images to web galleries, you will need to tell the story for publishing no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are already innumerable and will be deepened in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographic data. & digikam; can also export the photos at the location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Maps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information should be stored in the configuration page of & digikam; it should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the image to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the image is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright paragraphs though they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this, in the picture embedded metadata. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & Digest; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread Aberdeen</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you can find problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these should be dealt with carefully and you can't trust them for more than a few years. of course, you can buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality that last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that seems to perform miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray Disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disclaimer keeps your statistics for you. your manufacturer's warranties include a new disk but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disk drives on this topic: floppy error study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks will last longer when operating in the Temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reason is that SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART are due to the imminent failure. these are in particular Lesefehler and Verlagscounting ler. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only a complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also restore data loss due to a power failure before saving the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account for electric shocks, this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these anomalies can cause serious damage. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also includes overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it fulfills the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to phone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers provide over-voltage protection, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for laptops and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While over-voltage protection protects your system against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system. if you buy an UPS then you should be sure that it fulfills the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in case of electricity disruptions with the costs to avoid this. a high quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are at home compared to the hard drives home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution. it is too slow for that.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are referenced in photos. their free store is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in the case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory what should be verified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. due to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies included a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures that the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive is safe.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these faults remain undiscovered until a day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. nobody seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrf filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss for notebooks and 46% for workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the percentage of thefts is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most widespread file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption is higher and an undefined status will be avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. what is meant is that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural barrier for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are affected by data loss every year. so backup your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash will strike you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aeroplanes: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a frequent reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generate multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this fuse comes with an versioning system closest to the exception that is only sampled and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of the files that have really been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come up for backup but with & lt; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete check.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retained XMP files, retained, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, sight devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to look at everything that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to swallow a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the print outlet for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been detected by the system, but don't append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MByte; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # to change the size of travel if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if there is no more software you can read it yourself, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard of GIF. however, it can replace much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chroaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the drawback is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF may be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (default). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now at your disposal and we hope that Canon and Nikon will also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource blocking quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; which stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. however, XMP adapts to it because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, the raw format is deprecated. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & Edit, then you should add the metadata again. you may be cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the Adding a Photos to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & Edit; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description for this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need camera information for each entry. with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">Tab Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturers, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the Metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is to click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download the Selected. the Selected button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available for download. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digi. in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons All you want to download or download selected, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums tab. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & Edit; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you want to delete only a few, you have to select them first and then delete the selected one.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. so, you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a & digikam; album before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do so using the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are usually re-used after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two will affect the data on the author in the standard AutoriIdentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC-fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish another format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. switch the date & time option to do so. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option to use camera names, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which is edited; for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& nbsp; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it lets & digitise; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to disable automatic rotation, use the Advanced and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, it can & Edit; this is used to automatically download sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is downloading. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digities. a folder chooser dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be done from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architects and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser which indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitized; users who want to locate the location of the photo thus, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. so, the question is actually more, how the data come into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and last via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you have to save these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can use the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the predefined coordinates created by maps.google, for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Edit; tries to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam; to access these settings, you need to select Edit in the Settings menu; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing. you place the default behavior of & digicode; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this may be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image else & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC action stores the data into the corresponding IPTC field. this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the & Edit database; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be edited in & digicode; imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image inscriptions as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor in the main window rests over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & Edit; AlbumFolder that has none of these enhancements added, by & Edit; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire from & Edit can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the luminaire, these settings will be turned on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; All the image size ladenquot; if you have one, then you can obtain better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease image quality, since PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can switch the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality since the defect algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy resolution, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & Edit, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if you are sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid patterns with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance that is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the sharpness. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned, because of the inability of your camera to look at the top lights as a continuous white. to do this, you can use the setting-through white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results, as they can reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digw; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When choosing the Reconset option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the demo account small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data, which come from the color filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as a CFA interpolation or colour design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& nbsp; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests, it looks so. as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenes Directed) the quality for me and the paper used by me. VNG interpolation (Variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction, as it is carried out during raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & Edit; information as to translate color information from a color space to the other, so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask when an image is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Can set the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & Edit; Browse this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to lie down. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon that do not contain any colour mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate how your image would be given by a device. this is very useful before you print an image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what it is intended for. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile Expansion lets you see the style for the finish: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface it can & Edit; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these will then be edited by & Edit; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the Previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">For further information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can use the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left hand a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in picture display mode. currently, the camera supports serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & Edit; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert them all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the trash bin you can specify the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find further details in deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly edited by & Edit; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digikam; disable when starting. this may speed up the starting process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting When starting new photos is forcing & digitized; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam;. if something is deleted from the base folder, asks & digikam; you whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & Edit; used to customize the main window to suit your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use these to view and edit your photos and to preview and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; they may not be part of your distribution. you may find more information about the KIPI modules in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and underneath it the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu from the File menu or using the Recover of the Image Processing button in the toolbar. you will lose any change you've done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Restore or Restore by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the back or restore button on the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom out where you are using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar can be displayed. if you do not wish to do so, you can change it in the Edit Settings dialog. you can view it from the Edit window. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Exporting Pressure Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & Edit; main window has a sidebar on the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the text is copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, you either use the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the Apply button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the pregency IPTC field. the coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & Edit; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search term. you can quickly restrict the number of options in search of a keyword. this capability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief for entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered various keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords may also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is indicated. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to give you keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and filed there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off in Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be a or its, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry used in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. using a color-administered workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to squeeze for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. additionally, you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are via email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calliate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you must calliate your monitor, since sRGB is based on sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you must either calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, adjust, automatic comparison and contrast expand from the menu Conrigid Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the brightness values over the entire image, making the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Levelling: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. in this way, almost every brightness zone has the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Add contrast: this method enhances the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the largest possible area and a new jiusenisation of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited as a color space is worked with 8 bits per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by copyrighted Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Colors White Balance Sheet Editing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The target photos can be previewed with a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram is displayed that changes dynamically when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjusts you to improve the shadow details of your photos or also dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Load exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also add another photo to your original. if you save these settings, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding also needs more disk space, calculator time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the sub-window for brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under Colors Sound Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to use it for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & Edit; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cante filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, also called Sabatier, was the effect of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar conversion effect. the original image is the (1) and it works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called "Velviaquot" effect. it differs from a saturation so that it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film manufactured by Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrasting edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can preview the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the converted problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the intended use purpose.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders can be clicked into it and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the controller and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this box you can set whether the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear display is most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpoints can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two knobs which can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and loaded again later. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, medium and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of adjusting input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most meaningful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve part to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and darker the corresponding pixel pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marker is to be seen. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of & digitised; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change color gradations of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channels Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Colors channel blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are at the bottom right: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel blender then is THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible hiss that comes from the colour space. the color space consists of small artefacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise patterns look different in each channel. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colored first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load Buttons will be used exactly for this purpose. any mixers setting can be saved for later and then loaded. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the Blue Channel has been re-adjusted. the Luminance option is checked. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as colour images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, in all sceneries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and enhances the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold to the attunes. this is very similar to the process of bleaching and redevelopment in a Sepiphonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using & Edit; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait out of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu item Image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & Edit; adding tool frame can be a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the required frame type for your picture. throughout the picture borders with a colored line, niepce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), truncated it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & Edit; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you have to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to lower the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam, send an e-mail to the & digicode; mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the root folder button in the dialog. select the folder where you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder will appear. selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the entire image, you must resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitised; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. indeed, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus may be the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalization process needs to merge colors with minimal differences into one color point. this in turn results in blurred edges becoming blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a focus filter while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry to call up the Sharpples.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should do this carefully, because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool. you can refocus the tool through the menu entry. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for softness with the menu entry Conrigid softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter using the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out. an increase in the radius or the amount will amplify the effect. if you make the blurry mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges will create.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are hit by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference sum to be applied. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference with it for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from sharpening and therefore flaw errors in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original picture is the (1) and the painted picture the (2). blurry masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & Edit; tool refocus refocusses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocused quot; in which it reverses the default. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus usually achieves better results than blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauss's folding is actually very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is extremely blurred then pay attention to halo-ons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further blurb the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hot sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss' edge. use this parameter if your sharper is Gauss. this is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the sharpness or the Gauss' sharpness. note, however, that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load Buttons will be used exactly for that purpose. any refocus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the follow-up methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothens the blurring of the area which has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several preadjustments as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly smoother than homogeneous regions. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film or CCD Rauschen, a high value will generate wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to match the degree of smoothing in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles make a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal, but it doubles the term. we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Load exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with minor artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black Artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor movie overlay during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & Edit; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a fine-grained noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings sub-window can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can damage the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus cleanup smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, you may need to change the edge filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter cannot obtain image details and noise or forging occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can't be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak ruble or JPEG image file without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly smoked. however, it also merges shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is reacted to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is too high, noise and phase jitter may occur at the edges. it can remove noise spikes and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier to sharpen than a picture. to do this, use tools for softness with the menu entry Corrigible softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & Edit; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film, scratches, compression artifacts and local faults that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping. the texture mapping is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the restoration algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">Reduce JPEG artifacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefacts quot; - small standards that are to be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. so you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photograph taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The Hotpixel tool allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos, as many JPEG compression cameras have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Upload this file to the wizard with the Dark Picture button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in the connector to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the correct dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and load it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a one-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-quadratic surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & Edit; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise imbalance effects occur due to movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and colour or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation using a center filter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of greatest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the color gradation; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a densification correction and contrast correction was also performed in the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & Edit; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree considers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth degree corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils, the 'Corner Parameters has the inverted sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The pitch or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or resizing changes. it is best to perform this correction as the first one. if you want to cut a picture anew and then perform a tone-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove them with the cropping tool in the menu Transformers Cutting out of the image processing or via the Zoom Controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tone-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red feature of Gimpguru.org web site, which is accessible via this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters of film grained and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film grained if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller alters the amount of the film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes colour channels for reproducing infrared light, especially the green channel does not make any sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter effect on a landscape photo taken from New Zealand. the original image is shown in (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the shakers.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; Filter Gray is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grained on your images. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-like effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image acquires a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photo, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is set to ISO-2400 even though higher values are required. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO 1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & nbsp; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & Edit; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. flatten the smoothness or, look from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the machined is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & Edit; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you had chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob adjusts the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (flatten).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & Edit; Filter Gravure shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & Edit; Filter Gravure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is looked at by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom infinity: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sporting photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the image softly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image through accidental displacement of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basins in the picture and blurred them without altering the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then reconstruct it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose with the & Edit; image processing a range free of raindrops. to do this, use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the correct orientation using mirrors or turning. the tools for this can be found in the Transforming Rotate or Transformers menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you invent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. to do this, change the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflating was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and load are used exactly to do so. each single click for photo magnify can be saved as a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by magnifying a small picture of the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just need to use the mouse to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photo is cut away. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the trimming, use the button The Cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or File Save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folder aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the bottom of the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to aspect ratio, it stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trimming tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setting help settings allow you to blend assistance so that you can better compose your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party organ, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle with similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden partition in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your destination. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to guide the golden spiral. there should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, unlike harmonious triangles, gold triangles are no indifferent triangles. diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal and Vertical mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the guides. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can repair this with the & Edit; image processing and the tool free rotation. select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slide back to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function Transformers Zutruncation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatic cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New Height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle at the bottom left: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little smeared. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The fixing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shearing, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted into a parallelogram. you can start this module by Transformers Scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you click presets, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the control tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the lubrication, the picture gets blurred. for a single shearing this effect is mostly negligible, but two insulators create twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has blurred triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Edit; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & Edit.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependency on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & Edit; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. this reduces redundant information in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother outcomes than JPEG on the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless when it is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read very helpful guides in English using Wikipedia, The LUMINOUS Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Source File Converter from & digi.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF data of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the dialog to be viewed appears then. to perform a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data recorded at the same time in the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the timezone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have matching dates. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog turns the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the respective region and increase it. always select this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Image Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums you want to export to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each picture to create a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; skill show</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all its associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. naturally, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album Rider for the thumbnails, these are small pictures that are shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program settings to see if errors occurred during production. the web browser will be automatically started at the end to preview the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse frames. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below without the usual loss of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases because no compression of the color information takes place. for example, this can be found in PNG format again.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Module Digital Camera Client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Module Digital Camera Client does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please see exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can insert a base image transfer. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module via extras MPEG DiashScan.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that an image will be displayed. the speed of the image transition will be specified below. a lower value creates very sudden, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and path of the generated file can be specified under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can use the coding button to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly drink a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the jpegs and ImageMagick packages using the Settings button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print out with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera is in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or use them later on, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality worsens. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the if information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite existing files. this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can zoom or enlarge the image. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before. other images can be dragged to the list of sending images and dropping there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be shown with the images you have selected. you can also add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the image list to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Using the Delete button, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you just need to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you select are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used each time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original files will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can view the status messages in the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diashau appears a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you will need to have a graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File name option displays that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option allows you to display the presentation in an endless loop. you can then manually abort it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option Show images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order, so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures, the temporal distance between the pictures can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can stop and start the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date now has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI Module Background Image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphoto album; Browse through these, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in people, locations and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, look at the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images will appear on which both persons are visible. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on some single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view them with thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image, each person has the same icon in front of her name. however, you can save your own thumbnail for each person, which of course applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do so, you need to open the picture-picture window (described in more detail) and display the entry categories editor in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image should be displayed or truncated.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the Find entry in the main window, a dialog is displayed to you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can see this dialog once again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text. if you would like you can also enter a date to be searched for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all images according to specific names as shown in the picture. here, pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time start, or select the menu entry photoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and the time bar will always display the current date of the currently displayed images when navigating in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps. if you select a range, you will only be shown pictures of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">Photoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version described, which you can create via the File menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objective. in the following, each area is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on the photoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphoto album; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page. see more about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. please note that all images are exported from a party. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why this is not addressed specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, resulting in a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the root folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them there. in order for the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have merged all three to base folders and URLs. a subfolder will be created in these, whose name will be specified in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have already spent a great deal of time doing the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., you need to work with & kphotoalbum; this work does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file, or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it scans the images that are found in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file by means of HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images that you can exporting from the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether internal or external .kim files should act. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you copy Manually to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically to copy to .kim file copy & kphoto album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so anyway, just select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum picture size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import... menu, it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and watch pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover an image with your friend on it, you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has started as a program for managing your images, but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notices the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it in future starts. if you want to read a different database in & kphotoalbum; then you can start another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings k photoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of your photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will learn the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, there is a detailed help available, which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In this section sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up whole member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of a member like in explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits into its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be invoked through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can call about the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by multiple applications, it may be that modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before applying them to your own images using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I hadn't warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between the photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications sort their pictures into albums: even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for some modules after albums, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & photoalbum; the current album that is simply the current view, so all images that you are viewing the preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here & kart album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category people for example, it will do & kphotoalbum; so, so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can see from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and tool bar at the top. beneath the toolbar you will see the window with which you have entered your image database. currently, there is not much information, since you have not yet entered information about your images. in this section, we will look back to this window, but click on the entry image to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, etc. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text field by specifying people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you type information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the pictures within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, thereby, that the names used are moved up, can find and assign persons more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located below the thumbnail on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a group. to show you that this is a group, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub-category. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a subcategory of this entry. caution, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dragging the bar that forms the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a box by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button..., which among other things offers you the option to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to view this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the item Show images in your browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or of all images if you don't have a filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try again.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">And photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use with & kphotoalbum; namely, you need to have the pictures saved somewhere, so that you can record the photo album; you can view the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images showing the upper right corner are not saved on the hard disk. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can preview these images, but you can't view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and again. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now, to ask for inserting the respective CD. so if you want to avoid trouble as the confusion of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that in the end those who want to make you accessible to others and click Current View in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister can see, and lock the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images in the case of the case should be hidden. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu item Create images, so you can hide all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other hand anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to describe all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours of course is that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course he shows the image, but additional all information you have entered about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed at all. all these options are available right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, find matching entries to this. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus respectively minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete screen space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move into the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply draw a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom in again The Plus key zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom spell is selected and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot-key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. using the Sync button sets the zooms, so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out are with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can see the abrupt and configuration dialog of the image open to enter this name. however, you will probably prefer to mark the picture and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letters. in the picture you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have placed features on your images, they are available in your browser. so if you have selected all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you have selected, you can simply apply them all at once. this is described in detail. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window. if you display categories in the particular preview view, you can add features to the images by simply selecting the character for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will allow you to paint photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your mean later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see a picture painted on it. to switch on the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; click on the picture to paint from the context menu. to end the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; work, you need to use the program & Povray; not fully master, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu appears, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete selected objects from the scene with Delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified properties, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you have invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the texture selected. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the object properties view are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the user to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the user to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views one above the other, you drag the user in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring, pull the beginning water on the desktop or click the small to the left pointing arrow in the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window arrangement... saving. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering Symbol Edit icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can type any name, but useful is a name that lets you see the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties which are used by Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. in general, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling takes the neighboring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel continues to be divided and adapted because the recordable depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method POV-Ray pursues a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are charged by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, R 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Staff of abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are tracked separately and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch on Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler does not support the complete command-set of & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source text for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Properties view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height field data) in paths to & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the dots on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High detail faithful for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold values in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window arrangements. in the section Window ordinances it is explained how to create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector Default window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Existing window classifications list shows all existing window classifications. a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and deleting a selected order with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with the Unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view does not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners is very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should pay attention to the following warnings, before you complain that you will only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all error free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. therewith you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click it, you will see the content of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or press the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a straight (insert infinite body) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can fold the entry for the ground if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the horizontal line to the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose offset and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment you select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog where you can select how to insert the object. please select the first object. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can review the look of materials at any time with one click. also, there are many possibilities, but take the simplest one now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you now render your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the object tree you have to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step as you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the sphere can be as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor, as you have shifted the ground around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, type the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First object and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already give some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome plated surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities you can give you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a Render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical radiations from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and broken, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like for example fog work.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene that is to be rendered is needed, some sources of light and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back-end.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can modify or add new commands to & kpovmodeler using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diffraction on the surface individually without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a suitable file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Settings - & Cube show, there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, loads & kickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this makes your keyboard available to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common features, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripting.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; in addition, Amarok has some command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use the kDialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue Loaderror error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry '# {error}' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands. this usually uses the function exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Listen to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions to query more information about the new track (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume Signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu and itemTitle will also pass the path to the selected files in the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry has been clicked. to add an entry to the menu, you can use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM sends to the script. this signal should be processed to perform, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as myskript.amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly see the archive as an Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaustion amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the Wiki Scripts page of & Amarok; attach. for your entry on kde-apps, you should use the Amarok category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a certain title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can you never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlist browser is the right one for you. and if you still find it hard to decide, dynamic mode and smart playlists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, that the playlists window will roll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing to context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the section appearance you can adjust & Amarok; s look. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can specify the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting Own fonts the otherwise grey displayed section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, Player window and context browser. click Select... so you can select a font you want from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1223">Repeat playback at startup causes & Amarok; after program start, resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is enabled, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shade causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color spaces will open the color selection dialog. if you do not use your own colors, the default & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The option screen is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output tab allows you to select an audio driver from the drop down box. some drivers still activate additional settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The Collection Box collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; Browse to music files. in order to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up, how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; Browse both the checked and their subfolders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). also, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok; all found playlists in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) add to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedtelestop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and leave the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because taglib crashes when reading the Meta info from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is somewhat more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X then this leads to crash when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open during a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the Meta-Info, but do not characterize it as Unicode. the following perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: mplib; my $v2tag = $mp3 &gt; get _ v2tag; print" error when writing tags from $ARGV [0]\ "unless $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: Snikapp: symbol lookup error: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystem Tray9setpixel ERK7QImage, then please check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version, or modify / etc / ld.so.conf in such a way that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or the developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only appears an empty playlist. how do pieces of music come into there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively hold the interface, the start sub-window has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it in Tools Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist's title bar and select column rating. click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, therefore the actual question must be: which media types support GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support virtually any imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! perhaps you may use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which in default does not include MP3 decoders (due to patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, Enter key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (eg. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just want to hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decoded it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS encodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center sound & multimedia sound system. enable sound server run with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure the artsWrapper SUID is set:</seg>

<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use a different driver (xine driver has been strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffers in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffers, the less drege will react to the visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes and Amarok; from. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all components. perform the following registry to register all of the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if this does not help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (stop Amarok before!): - Download and install ffmpeg, compile and install it. then delete all the ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with you-config / Gstreamer-config) and execute the registry once again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save it with the help of the Playlist button. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlists window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the option to importing playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right-click on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires the installation of some software packages. the packages required are listed below. additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with & Amarok; pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (such as RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, it also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. however, the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a scroll bar displaying the currently running piece or the current stream. directly below it is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including text display. you can switch through the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifiable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are located below the running text display. the button PL activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and change to next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 default settings, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the Main Menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist by & Amarok; is the most widely-developed playlist for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that it does not give in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, the left hand side is the navigation area. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three sub-windows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information shown there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; also the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and the last time, as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the pieces received are the favorite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information is to be displayed in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if not yet a text script is running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are sorted according to artist and below them a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Group Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - Your pieces are sorted by genre and then sorted by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works exactly like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a drop-down selector with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you have different time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year. you can also select your entire collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in your collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attaches to a playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the media player. for more details, see the Media Player browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files into the trash bin... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears in various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Undo compilation-selection - Changes an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. after that the album is no longer listed in various interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes dealing with many playlists quite simple. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent playlists are possible. click Smart Playlists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for connecting & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod according to artist, sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, you exit & Amarok; and solve the drive integration for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you will find a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist will last longer than in the window, the holding of files by simple dropping can be difficult. in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries to the desired location and dropping them. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter, for example, one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms, search for entries that contain either the one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations with one another. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist. to the right, you will find Playlist, Load Playlist, and Randomly Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar you can find a unique, augmented analyzer. the rate of refresher can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button on the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you will get in the player window by right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, playback wheels and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and selecting toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. additionally, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. you can use this menu to access & Amarok settings.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the Visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry hides a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images. you can start them by selecting Actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big entry into & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, a number appears in the playlist next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">The administration of the queue allows you to open a queue management tool. if you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the sequence of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-specified (the details of the installation of these playlists).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: audio crobbler). this mode requires that some pieces already exist in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click the desired playlist, drag it to the playlist window or right-click on it and then select Load. thus, your current playlist will be replaced by the new one.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two preset modes of Random Mix and Playlists mix immediately complete your playlist and you can directly start playing. the recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece change, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, select the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point. the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry.</seg>

<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way to recharge recently opened projects. the associated submenu contains a list of these projects. clicking on an entry will open the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. once the project has already been saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new filename.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new filename. KDE's dialog Save As is shown where you can select folders and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call for every single project file Save.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has been modified and has not yet been saved, ask & k3b. you can then choose between saving and modifying. you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Includes all opened projects. & k3b; will ask for each unsaved project what to do with it as if you had called closing for each project file Close.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and ends & k3b;. for each not saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called File Close.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Open the "Burn" dialog for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described above the What is the? -help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it prompts & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you put files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session are always included, even if this function is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active Data CD / DVD or Video-DVD-Project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function does not remove any files from the medium, it only hides the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD copy dialog. this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a DVD which you can then burn later. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not supported yet, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW, so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), thus the content will be completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes superwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously created CD image. the dialog will ask you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the Content View, but can also be used standalone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the content view and include the properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of the toolbar of & k3b. if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their contents will be shown in the Content View. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locks and locks of the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view also allows you to select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headboard is a narrower area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headboard has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can customize the keyboard assignment.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general application settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and type of task is crucial, which of the included programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you are using the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; common, support & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copy.dvd () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void copy.dvd () void autocdImage () void autocdImage () void burndvdImage ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can generate a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createfoder (Qstring name) void createForder (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addresls (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring parent) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring Newname) void setVolume ID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createfolder test dcop $PROJECT createfolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createfolder bar / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio Creator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& Audio Creator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encoded these wav files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the tracks of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into mp3 or OGG format or other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiobuilder; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you have to install lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodizer provides a small introduction about encoder, audio quality, and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudio creator; cdparanoia to read out audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can handle protection, it is not possible to bypass any proprietary audio CD; just avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up must be done only once (but the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained. this (hopefully) leads to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoders programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can fetch informations from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the step by step example, you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB inquiry of the CD data according to the device's request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup ples - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read from a different encoder than the default. it must be noted that before the encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file will be selected for encoding rather than a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as protocols, pics) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudioWizard; with various flashcards (such as Encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices generally only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset media '= This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and self-coilers. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to file size then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiovisual; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoder explains the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; to add title to the keywords (English: day) when encoded with lame, the -tt from lame and the title Parameters of & kaudionoon must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioIDE; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / write audio CDs, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering into the host. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the Pieces, etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translation) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; and in addition, neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiovisual; is active a check box to select (Send an address). for the use of freedb it may be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries there are copies of the main database. if & Audio Creator; for the use of freedb, the geographically located mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save to WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more about it, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, there are predefined values for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodizer can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check device name of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive that is installed on both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1.</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something inside the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiovisual;, something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what should be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with which freedb to use the & CD; download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The box CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server during reading the & CD; connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is easier, becomes a & CD; it is associated with low risk, if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries resulting from it, it can easily be changed. the directory or file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load is distributed among the machines. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work exactly as far as the server is concerned, but as many firewalls are booting the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the protocol is usually open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Numbers at the same time: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this box to check out the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you click this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. if you do not want to make this folder, if you want to do something with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right in order to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the --id3 v1-only 'entry for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1.' ID3v2 tags' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tempted to code more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic set up of & kaudionoon; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is established, because we want to pick up data from the freedb. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; use which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from that for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; to manually enter data instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, the & CD must now be inserted in the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, search the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; gives, a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query by freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database but the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist must no longer be entered in the input field" "" "Current title" "", "unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field below can be used for individual comments, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiobuilder; maximum allowed. this option is set on the encoding settings tab; have a look at the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding / file formats. see the Help for the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the output CD; in this example this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you return to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. just enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the tracks that are selected will be read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All Parts button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the selection button to read the selection process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first part is just read on the disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message when trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed. items that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. the computer used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1622">Session support. when you exit & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button on the toolbar, select the pick-up from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you move it to the & kmid; (with several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and thus change the playing speed. to get back to the original tempo, double-click on the template LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, so interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text inclination, others use lyrics and again both. some pieces have no lyrics at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can adjust what events should be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which uses a song so that you do not need to manually set up automatic text selection, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify a type of event, select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in the series. in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organizing.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection is not saved. remember if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic adding to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the pieces that continue to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the row after the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next song button, record next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return a song back, select the preceding piece button, the item Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI map compiles general MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet if a piano was originally played.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map, because all sound cards GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the map"... END Define keymap "Another key map..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that default is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All KeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun, for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a touch with Patch 127 (kick shot), it will take Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and play the sound 60 regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant that each note is a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one at which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how notes are mapped onto a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The keymaps are used above all to map tones to the percussions-channel. look as an example of the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword will be used with the name name for this channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is where pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which gets a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, should play a ton higher. unfortunately, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a drop down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played sounds. view in the Settings menu under the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the left and right arrows from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; that allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to produce very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, so support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First of all, enable Automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the temporary files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the Automatically adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.B., B.B. and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically adding to the collection and open A.M. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then choose to play B.Smid and Xmid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, I encourage me to write on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; in the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an enhancement of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write to me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me happy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and managed by no one for it. I would therefore like to emphasize that I only use programming because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid, with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save favorite links under the menu bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' recent pieces', television and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do it if & KMPlayer; you can simply click on a name of a category, select it from the View menu and see next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select the playlists from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Animation on starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SME; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end of the animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be displaying a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">"" "another tool for troubleshooting is the" "" "Console" "" "button in the tool bar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as setting up the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & SME; to play the 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash must be specified in the configuration dialog file Assets of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror oder & KMPlayer; can be used in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (View, Console, or Console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a given backend for a particular mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SME; can play from TV cards either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer dialog is to be used in Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be found ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for this reason, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, different names are used by SME for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>

<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to be run as user root after installing the device. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom mounts on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. under Unix-like systems it is likely to apply to the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components may be included in the used & Linux distribution. the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project contains some already compiled packages from & Kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly have to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the Kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions about or when compiling & Kile; or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; desktop. & Kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, & Kile provides the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate;</seg>

<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview about & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book about it. to master & latex; properly master, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As well as other markup languages include & latex; an introduction to which the general properties such as paper format, page numbering and text gres are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and has to be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Kile; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) offers some possibilities for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], Article (DIN) [scrtcl], a book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], foil [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: this is set to set the character encoding. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding than standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for the correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for & latex; for the incorporation they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Buch (DIN), Review (DIN), Cover (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a brief description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - as well as other source editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable ones). by & Kile; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When setting up a new command (e.g.\\ end {command}) of & Kile, an empty line (e.g.\\ end {command}) is automatically generated by setting a new command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the menu settings... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the highest and subcategory the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking the respective button.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when selecting your own. once a DVI; file is created, jumps & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the commercial output eart of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the reverse search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked becomes the exact opposite of it. as soon as one clicked on a section in the & latex; source text, the corresponding position is jumped in the DVI; Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master Document: this function is used in working with multiple files. with a master document, work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set via Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is referred to as a part of the toolbox, and there is no call to & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection boxes should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for fast integration of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick classification of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -instructions for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as keywords, joints or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection above a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">Using quote will display a selection list with literary entries. at & bibtex; works this only if the file is going to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down selector with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size. it can be used to define the font sizes for the main text, the joints, etc. the following types of text are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and stacking the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12 pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also occur later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the MenÃ ¼ s Building or buttonâ s quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; execute the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, you should look for the errors in the logging process. if you are using a quick build & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created, and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} may be added as a part of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only caused within the environment (by\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, there may be certain fonts, bold prints, italics, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid until it is closed with\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a sentence can be italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; -markup language is represented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be performed. for this, at least one quotation, a few passages in fat and italics and a poem should come to see the differences in these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor-View or Ctrl-E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .di output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document (see) are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed (in the viewer) by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source text, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preference search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; files. to do this, simply set up Modern under Settings box... Building tools must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To perform the preference search, the pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on forward search. the jump to the corresponding position in DVI; the viewer is then made.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; insert & box; open and jump to the appropriate line. for this & Kile; in & eyepiece; specified as text editor (Setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you do not want to open the & DVI Extender function, an error can be found. if an error is present, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file tells the source of error in the source code. in the editor you can use the previous LaTeX errors and the worst LaTeX errors for jumps between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the faulty line, the error in logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button on the toolbar, a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-on users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in & Kile to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... settings General settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. if an easy way to create a template, it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below will be searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be invoked via the menu LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; that means that in this way, clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip is only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button pressed, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most varied types of source contexts and to emphasize these. for example, the & latex; -commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. it is an own type of bookmark within the text. the mentions edit jumps or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump-mark. thereby, this jump-mark is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already excellent opportunities offered, were added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added. & latex; special instructions for their selection. under Edit Styles the following commands are included for selection of text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with transparent lines (like in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only point in this case is that the Abysstze are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word in the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command will also include & latex; -commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To allow a part of the document, it can be checked at first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Removal, the following commands are included in the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is contained in the description to edit paragraph heel.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the best view can be lost quickly. this command completes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the sharpened clip of a & tex; -group #, jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups braces, the best view can be lost quickly. this command completes the recently opened group, so the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple suits are used as a bottleneck. for the practical implementation it is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple reference marks." & Kile; knows this case and includes two closing signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX to be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Custom settings (e.g. German or French) and therefore German or French accents can also be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting Shift; Enter key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, close & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with a closing line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings box; added to LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et-characters (amp;) among themselves. & Kile; tries to invent this. although this tabulator is unfortunately not the added, add & Kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offering a good source code completion, it has been expanded in & Kile; three different modes (mostly for & latex;) have been added. three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings Box... complete.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} will & Kile; automatically add the\\ end {environment} command after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back key, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to grind down the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can also be used, so that a jump to these positions can be possible by working jumping brand NÃ ¤chsten jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be used.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Setting up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. there can be various items lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wiper books of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the invocation mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the surroundings are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the fully-quit environment or key key Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically inserted into the environment and it will appear\\ begin. after that, the ambient effect can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of sections that are replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile can be set up. as an example of a subscription list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word assignment mode is initiated via the menu editor or pressing Ctrl + Alt space bar, the letter L will be replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large washers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noted that many more users are written in a document more than once. thus, & Kile provides the complete support for all previously written questionnaires.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu settings... Kile can be deprecated. here also the treshold for displaying the completion can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder. mode is available for Abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog displays graphics as simple as possible. in order to view the basics about the graphics formats, the sections should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for the changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to examine the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the tools are grouped in the menu Create compile, create conversion, and create views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used to the single Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer with Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file converted into a PS file and by means of Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is being asked about the Project New Project.... The following information is being asked for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The Script function of & Kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed and can change in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts is in & Kile; a system-wide object (= box) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a fairly sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; provides a lot of different aids to support users.</seg>

<seg id="1864">A complete Refernz for & tex; and its part-of-the-art circle of friends. this is not only a description of all programs (but some important packages are described) but rather is a complete user manual for the & latex; commands contained and is thus ideal for the search for a specific formatting. since it is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; the finding of the right document is not always easy. as possible help provides & tetex; / texlive; the small application texturtk, which contains a database with all the & Kile; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the larger advantage is the search for package names or folders. by & Kile; only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the menu Plugins Edit. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins is used without a storage location & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unambiguous identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and clicking the Setze as a button. the currently selected member (their identification) appears fat after which they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific is happening. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments through the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Notes to be entered is simple. either the note -entry from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comments text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the nickname of the introduced nickname of the team member, role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Quanta settings... This dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including auto completion can be changed with this.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Small-notation of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means, the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means, the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this will be inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Non-optional tags automatically include: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and end tag: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatically replacing accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. by using the Default button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file Open opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped), but this setting here is stalled by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. this setting here, however, is eliminated from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly, so that in a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next launch of the program. this is not the same as saving the file. even for unsaved documents a backup will be created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come across by changing MDI modes and docking / hanging views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages section is used for controlling the possibility of switching off warning messages by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PLCs and the source text view in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the figure of the parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action soldered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the tree's update frequency when editing and how deep is to be opened automatically when changing the structure tree. empty knots are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting abbreviations (a type of templates) that will unfold when editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid batch for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plug-ins can be managed here. plug-ins are part-applications from third side, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path to the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in the "read-only mode" mode: check if the plug-in denies the load. only-Read-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, try & quantaplus; if the information entered is correct, then the plugin can also be saved if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, which adds support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector can be used to change the specific settings.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view showing the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally does not need to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session Started the session. closes the connection to the debugger or stops listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells the debugger to start executing the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debugging request has been started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Tells the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution goes on. if it happens before a debugging request is given, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that can be found on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can customize & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can help you get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document Type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the tool bars. tag folders contain two file types, the file descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. tool bars are handy, symbol-oriented bodies of image buttons (above the editing pane), which can insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details of conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tag XML files, then the file descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML Files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day indicates. the file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a typewriter.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can occur only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the method method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. that's a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Specifies an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling for attributes in tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for a attribute description. it is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (i.e. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is a just-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All tag XML files must start with an XML; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the tag XML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not yet available. currently, the check takes place only when you load the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tagXML file. this file describes a & PHP; overload function. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag &lt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "name" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD-editing DTD settings. with this diedescriptionrc; for a select & DTEP file; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. clicking New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">Button shortcut assigned to this action. clicking the user-defined button can be used to assign a keyboard shortcut; Keiner is the current key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way & quantaplus; the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document URL. in the event of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input, you can specify what to send to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages are directed to the standard output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the checkup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialogue "Edit Tag" when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiwedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually seen as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -day in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the icon, it must still be joined with the action. this happens through the menu with settings to set actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags if there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into multiple groups. open the tool bar to set dialog about Settings tool bars. make sure the required toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup to the correct folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their file descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notorious extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; repository to check if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation now; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contexts separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, tool bars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; -users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a financial contribution we recommend to sign the resources for what it requires a GPG / PGP key. this guarantees the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can choose one. in the Create New Resource you will need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click on OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD (DTEP) menus, upload tool bars, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format. there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD store and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target Directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definition line: the string that should appear in the! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, spantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adjusted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is selected as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related items are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to tool bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the project folder tree, which emblys the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the tabs with information and the tool bars. please hit in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all file tabs, reload, delete or upload the document, skip to a bookmark or execute CVS instructions on the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click on the editing pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content, such as basic processing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window, the tool bars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, for example, & lt; then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this straight inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction supervisors (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and strip them. in the representation with tabs are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouseclick. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be done with the contextual menu that appears.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script languages. the concept of breakdown in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right clicking on an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can be changed. the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development to find. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached, edited and viewed project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively reinforced and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar Archive by & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can save and load them in & quantaplus; like any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup languages editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why Development, what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding, it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to utilize an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and tool bars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or execute khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and looked after by Eric Laffa Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; write, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very useful when your & PHP; -Script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of the script and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Start and turn the problem report at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar at the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project tool bar. these are stored in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be set by means of settings... added. tool bars are saved by toolbar buttons, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload tool bars to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading one & DTD; that made you or someone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP need to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a standard submenu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag settings dialog if there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; the insertion is denied by tool bar if this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu the available plugins are listed under the above menu items. click on it. click an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-ending identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of the user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries the switch may sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. by selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, as the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically after filling out the project name. all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemp.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on setting the remote host an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Check if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the hooks, clipping out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. in the Project Properties menu, these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the sub-window profiles or changed using Shift + F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, will be excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Uploading profiles can be uploaded to upload profiles (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by contacting one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can switch event actions and add, modify or delete events. event actions will be executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot be affected at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project Menu or the Project Open Project from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are as well, however the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu that can be activated with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is faded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programs. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk saving option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>

<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool bars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings Toolbar Project tool bar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars are stackable in & quantaplus; the best way to design via the menu tool bars. use and addition differ. adding tool bars is handled below in the section Add toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Tool bars and symbols can be set using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar) in which new action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as tool bar, tool bar rename or tool bars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog, where actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up Toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essence document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates as basic as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you choose for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents by shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. further information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more special documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and arranges the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted into the documents again and again. you can contain everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As Template Save as Local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save Selection as Local / Project Template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn easily with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. it can use all file management functions for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create site template, enter a name for the template and save it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very target-oriented approach. you can prepress headlines and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow Templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described previously; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden as soon as parental attributes are verbalized.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template table. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly activated. if nothing appears, the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows for previous or displayed text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to add content templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, by using the context menu (pointing to right mouse button), you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor, where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor on a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol shows the Vohanddependency of & PHP; -Source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the VPL; the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, the key pressure moves the active cursor from one window to the other, while the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor can be set up using Quanta settings.... Choice of VPL; -view can be selected between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted in addition: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it's possible to choose document properties. thus editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. clicking on the list allows the change of the content, e.g. key words on the name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is not supported at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible, as in word processing, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves as usual. the marking functions as usual. text can be inserted by typing in and by means of a return button or reset button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is made in the same way over the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it should be noted that inserting tags previously already existing tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other tag should be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar buttons such as the spreadsheet assistant or the list assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was to compare and merge folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge will be fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the merge-Editor under the differences window allows you to solve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check codes, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more anger when somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 kimper3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows for manual typing of file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog registers your selection and displays them again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merging of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the compare / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in Open dialog you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files first, upload them in & kdiff3; then you can easily copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can do nothing out of & diff3; pull out only the dropping of text into a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can see at the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not as important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are enabled, the line is displayed dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an info line with the title edition:, the filename and [Change] if you edited the result. usually it contains text already, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons jump to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, any difference at the same time is also a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the group will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing there is no more line left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; There is only one placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy this text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, side down, start, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the Conversion section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Strg-Up), the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image Inside / Strg-Image Abreverse) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, the clipboard is automatically copied and the manual copying is dropped. however, be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a newline feed character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered toastert. on these systems the button presets automatically set an unfilled color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted at pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line is also automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. no manual copying to the clipboard then is omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored. in this step white characters will not be ignored. even when merging white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character\\ r 'and a line feed'\ 'at the end of a line, others save only a newline feed'\ '. usually, the carriage returns are made visible, although they are treated differently. when this option is checked, this option must be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, the numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Looking intensely after even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are used as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the option Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflict from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you have to start & kdiff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for the encoding, a short note appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-coded overview column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be shown next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just use the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is also specified (see above), the output of the command is used only at the end of the line. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-compiling command for line calibration to convert the input to capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\)\\ 1 / 'This. * is a cumulative expression that fits all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the translation string will refer to the found text in the first pair of brackets. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $Keyword generated text $. therefore, a pre-processing command for line reconciliation is needed. the\\ before the $is necessary because $is a special character and would mean the end of the line.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further preprocessing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from one another. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / ZIP 'However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations will only change the data that the line-like algorithm will see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline processor will see the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge whole folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selects selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just need to open folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, then folder 1 will be used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, then use & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While entering the folder, a small message window informs about the current progress. if you cancel scanning the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, it shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually shown together. you can fold a folder by double-clicking on + / - or by double-clicking on the item or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions, and all subdirectories are opened with which you can open or fold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed again about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is green, then yellow and later when it is old, turns red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchronize directories is active. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that after that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied & kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging (unsure) is enabled, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different but the same date is identical.. As long as the files are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will be processed after another. you indicate status column when merging was successful, and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode, B will be used as a destination, B will be chosen as the destination and when synchronizing A and / or B will be used as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Options Permissions, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select another folder merge / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, then a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3 will continue; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When you commit to a bug, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to issue the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you can try again to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Setting up Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the Elementtree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders matching this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders matching this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatic generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be shown in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is turned off, symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links will show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is turned off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that the link contains a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected so that after that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this will be considered insecure because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed. if an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge of entire folders. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible during the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch off the window divider with the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the folder & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. as soon as you save the result, the status will be saved to replace and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders to open on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters have to be masked (# - &gt;% 23, space- &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidence of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KSli3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview - KDiffuser Part from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & diff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now called Kompare) are already available. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by strolling in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably not notified the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE does not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters varies, these lines are treated as identically, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines will be next to each other, this term is defindence but this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required for this has been too big so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to process larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; published and the text can not be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should have no problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. paste (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the update folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There will only be entries showing differences. this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops and applications running therein. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager... and exit. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager; in addition, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimum, Maximize, On Desktop and Been.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is checked together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, and eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the & Kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty worktops are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the windows with its standard icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be specified: classically lets & kpager; in a 2xN grid, as from pager applications appear in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical line, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog yet, but you can do this manually:</seg>

<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key or use the & MMB file, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of features. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save to a file, copy it into the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the update of the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouseclick as soon as the mouse pointer stays on the same spot. it is intended to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse-click causes pain. moreover, it can emulate dragging with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and, as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The smart moving is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can execute the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before the kmousetool; a mouse click passes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait until it starts the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function activates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and click here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool will be started; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last press is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular the smart move should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent delay.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually rather simple. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as it happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent delay in this case, this means that you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you run a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it. however, park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, a accidentally move can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent delay, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible in this way to mark text, copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action at which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advices for this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using the kmousetool; select text instead: run a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when smart moving the shift time starts. later, you can use the intelligent delay even without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. this should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to be pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dropping can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktops; for normal work with & ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech tool. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace falsely spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to bypass certain deficiencies of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand how filters work, it is important to know how the program" "" "speech dispencher" "" "works with a text. & ktops; distinguishes four types of texts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; - Notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order you send from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktops; just one such reading, this issue is stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to screen readers' output. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders, as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Substitute symbols replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions. & ktats; is provided with predefined string replacement filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -reformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktops; for example, if you have set a female voice on the voice card spokesman, you can read text from KDE messages about it. let's read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each filter has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; - Notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters that were set up on the bottom. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not enabled and will not be used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the subsequent installation dialogs will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the set-up of string replacement filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name at will, you just have to distinguish yourself from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is executed from top to bottom in the displayed sequence.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter will only be applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application-id-running programs will get you with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 shows, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions with an entry in the box do apply a filter if they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited on both sides by separator characters.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can view it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions. den & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package cequilils.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the voice selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card reader, or to a speaker with certain characteristics. for example, you can specify that the texts should be read by kmail from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before a text is passed to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program sends, which sends the text to & ktops; with the speaker output filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try anchoring the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected, which is best suited to the requirements you want. click the button to the right to show the dialog for subscriber selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses an adaptable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you would like to expand it, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & tp, you need a KDE (version 3.4 or newer) development environment, including the kdelibs packages and the "speech-dispatcher" program files.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktops; from the source code archive for downloading and downloading the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using it, first check if the speech synthesizer is working properly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops; the program kttmsg should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech dispensers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can leave the propositional or paragraph style, repeat, pause or stop output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text to & tts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker, whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen. if you want to learn more about it, select a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the tab Spokesman on Add button, and thus insert a speaker in the list or click Edit, the Box Spokesperson setup will be shown. see below for details of the module for Festival Interactive.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to Festival is contained in PATH, you just need to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text passed at the festival. in voices, the & ktops; known, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages are using ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust volume, speech rate and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and display this grey, the voice you select does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need several seconds to be loaded on account of their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so (with larger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker or click Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed at the start of ktmgr. otherwise, only the symbol ktmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktmgr is not running yet, it appears in the system area once KTTSD reads a text, so you have the possibility to read or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the currently edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card reader.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aCode is to be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you need to install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the unit speed here. 501;% corresponds to about half and 200.% about double normal speaking speed. so that these settings can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>

<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you will have to find out which device works with you. in doubt, select Default.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. after reading the screen reader, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you have just read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, add & tts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will be played whenever a normal text order is interrupted. if both the sound and the introductory message are active, the sound will be played before the incoming message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this tab only apply to normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the issues of screen readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read the Notify messages, start ktmgr and click Notifications. the notification card will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to enable read & kde preview; if this setting is unchecked, the rest of the settings are disabled and & ttts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications, where a sound is played, will be played by & ktops; not read before.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click on the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and event that you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the conversation, sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for marking text for voice output. this standard contains stamps for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. moreover, brands are part of the voiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the default voice, the festival uses in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100ms;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;? [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs are subject to text in single movements. this means that only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also skip or stop orders on the map card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set border detection filter. at the first start of & tp, a set limit acknowledgement filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add other propositional detection filters, but beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker's selection. turn off the speaker selection and select text for reading. check out the unit selection, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or abort text orders on the map card even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set border detection filter will be set up automatically if you start ktmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tabulation mark (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set border detection filter maintains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set border detection filter from mistake, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & tts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card reader selection, you can override the speaker settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card speaker). in other words: no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select the speaker. otherwise, select the speaker. otherwise, select the speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language lies before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the range speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the drop-down selector and then use the speaker that matches the following below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is available for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number, the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes instantly when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get trackback.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktops; you probably have to register GStreamer. in case of GStreamer 0.8.x, the command-register-0.8 is installed. if the problem is not solved, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time. when I receive a text order, it freezes & tts; a. on the & Console; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">The problem is that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed them and can use them in the festival, but ktmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivald / vocals. when this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, send it to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio, there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card for subscriber setup. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & tts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) disable either the filter for converting & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML reshaping filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktats; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. that festival does not produce errors, the xsl file accuses to converting SSML to Saber the GENDER-tags. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I added a custom string replacement filter and now I can move in & ktops; no more by default or back. on the tab orders will be displayed, the job consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You are not allowed to filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). use a filter for puncture border detection instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the default register before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / streamer.freedtelestop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system also counts, you can't simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktops; freezes if you stop a text order and then launch another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">With July 2005 aCode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktops, the current set will be read before.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speaking speed but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is available on most & Linux; -CDs already.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded and downloaded as tarball (with tar packed archive), log in as a normal user and unpack the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime-dependence of non-free software.

<seg id="2767">CD dicridescent echo kttsd &gt; inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd-tsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before using it, check first if your language synthesizer is working properly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you will find help in the instructions supplied with the festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices of MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, Festival is the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA ® synthesizer. then festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; produces the audio output from it. the & MBROLA; program and the MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that MBROLA; not a full voice output system. & MBROLA; generates language from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone.

<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktops; with any language synthesizer which can be controlled in a desk; on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows managing network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be invoked by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetwork.conf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings is displayed at & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured functionally, so & knetwork.dll, which displays the device at all and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up for installing & Linux; installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by matching the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected at & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this is attempted to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release status. by selecting non-again questions the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. by clicking on the button system management mode, you will get to the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available, divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interfaces tab is used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button 'interface'... in the dialog box set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatic, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP server can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The TCP / IP configuration can be set with the option manual without DHCP or BOOTP. the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the IP address input field.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface while booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as needed. switching on a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be enabled or disabled, depending on your needs. switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface needs to be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address like about 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the name resolution allows you to easily manage this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons behind or below in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator for name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... the Edit dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list name commonly known calculator describes the hostname-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list includes named hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this version of IP, which is still in the test, should replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add... Add New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the Add button. if the known host has multiple alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Knowing Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">One of the following tasks can be executed, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately operative in the system. to enable the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a GUI can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice, but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworka.The following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technique will be given, in the second section all of & knetwork.conf; change configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IPv6 has never found a large spread. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. therefore, IPv6 is expected to focus on IPv4, which is widespread in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in other networks, on the & eg; the network administrator is the contact point that sends a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if any other content is found there than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another state than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first thing was to create a surface for tar which also offered the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used it must be included in & dat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; RST the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detect & dat; the pre-tensioning device on the tape does not know, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the pre-tensioning device, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was inserted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by flaps out the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be thrown out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & dat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape of & kdat. floppy drives usually precede a formatting of the tape, DAT drives however do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity & dat, proceed with formatting the tape. all the data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process the tape is automatically included and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the Backup dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test has been started, the dialog will appear for Verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the verification settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be restored have to be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore from the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the Settings dialog will appear. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the band index file based on the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index in two ways from the band New:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the folders that are listed under backup files, only the files located therein will be backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar separately from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then have been backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to identify changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & gt; lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive. on some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & dat; to lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing & Kdat, it is automatically discarded. do not use this option on floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & dat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to report the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; formatted a tape, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, whereby the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape was formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the log files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for syslog server format and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the main protocol-file of the system - the system log - will open. it will not be displayed to you, and it will open up instead of its a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator rights. the log files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for which normal users usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string. to do this, enter a string in the filter bar. the list of the log lines is now changed automatically, so that only the log lines are displayed next to the filter. then a log line is only displayed if the string of the filter keyword is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter-search term will be matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol-file system log, select the process name, and also add the name of a process in the filterbar; this will show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the Level Errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than minutes lines of the Level Note. the color display of protocol lines can be switched on setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show specific processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can display the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the To New Lines option in the main window context menu to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a Protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kesystem log; also, you'll find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for program start-up when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to System V Init without needing a new installation and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you would like to start when booting the system or switching to another Runlevel. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are based on rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d when you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when booting.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the beginning range a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you will fix it by reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server run level that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition I could also have a user runtime, the & eg;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not trivial: just drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (resp. stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runtime or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area. to copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the destination area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target zone of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sort numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to enable the different working ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard-run-leveln, and now the machine constantly restarts. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt in linux single and press the Enter key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for run under Runlevel X but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution, please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg & eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that they can be attached to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either you can use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a map card will be created where you can make individual settings. other flashcards will appear if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Pass Password Management appears if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD universes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one mounted file system (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space limitations each in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with placeholder constraint</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tab groups informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, you will find in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu User or Group or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
