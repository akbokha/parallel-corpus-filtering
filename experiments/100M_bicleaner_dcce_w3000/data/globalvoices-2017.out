although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and ran his sport .
in fact , this country had such a deep impact on me that I became a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain with his opinion , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and its voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schauung compl@@ ained not with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still adapts herself to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Rich@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump re@@ proved its way to the nom@@ in@@ ative Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man looking down on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Ed . ) : as much as the wh@@ ites revol@@ t against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities , white and whi@@ plas@@ h word play in all@@ usion , as the great Van Jones described , has just killed what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ or , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; said Mr. Khan , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your Americas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your Americas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for whom his son fell , sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart to me .

from misery to stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by tr@@ ash
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of I@@ OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ater@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places has changed not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular with tourists -@@ but worlds apart from nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs fire .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth such a rare ray of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI comments :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with gl@@ it@@ tering eyes and playing in the bu@@ stle you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Wa@@ ste pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and live with him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that tackl@@ es wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it opened the coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at its time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( illegal fishing ) .
alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had sold out of their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and are mutually exclusive where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail pace with information between individual countries , the actions today are happening in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for authorities to design@@ ate ships fishing in prohibited areas . also , such suspi@@ cious itiner@@ aries can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal enterprise .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to return estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lost every year due to illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , forged ro@@ y@@ alties , indication of fantasy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ completely organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot run my harbor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has so far been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspi@@ cious ships .
it revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i shall help to find criminal vessels with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine conservation organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide using the position of each track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without license and hardly had any consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets that were forbidden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries are now also copying us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too are fighting against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With security , the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions , &quot; Cop@@ eland says .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to sign its first big triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s removal .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the ref@@ unds of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country , including the Bar@@ inas area , in the Andes region Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central North of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans due to an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the holding up of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the rate of inflation and violence is among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum applied to many as the only way to return the country to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , called on the demonstr@@ ators to take a mass rally to support the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , was planned to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards did not have !
in the meantime , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round , which covers the scale of oppression every day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado declare that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that , from their point of view , has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis and has rather occupied critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba against his father .
the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 was investigating crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not realise that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called on me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP .
just ins@@ ist that they don &apos;t kidn@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I &apos;d become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ Sin@@ ce the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - all possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were put down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I looked inside and saw a couch being tor@@ tured on humans .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they fastened it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying just there .
she rarely held a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and hun@@ ted him with a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for someone to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing e@@ ye@@ wear .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face - all were tied in hands and feet .
near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me somewhere else ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero crashed and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the survivors , the civilian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came up to be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen stuff home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges that one takes away from an enemy that was fought .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who st@@ ole your cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded rage , hit me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself .
for this we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I told the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle jum@@ per made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , I accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I answered , no problem , they could burden me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families to whom they were able to surrender their mortal remains ?
the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly pushed off and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I y@@ elled :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I was reporting the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am bi@@ ased . I ended up against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including heavy , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 F@@ athers were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court imposed lifel@@ ong sentences and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ state terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the search for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located to set up a memorial site , which is now headed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was broadcast in the social media .
edit the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center where you can extend their driving licence , last month witnessed a very mis@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ ha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind thoughts and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
edit the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which has been published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to the elderly and an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was replaced later by the more appropriate , if not quite correct designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture was ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents in the country is quite a reason to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 sei@@ zur@@ es were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens convic@@ ted 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased during the same period .
the Repor@@ ter , named in particular , brought comments to the light in the article published in Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese osten@@ si@@ bly opposed to older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So flaw@@ ed is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the belief that translators in the target language should not be in the source language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English language skills are rated as the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that arise through machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more thorough translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and the Parliament &apos;s tasks were transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an operators are again blocked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I logged in to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ ata later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also affects the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests concerning certain domains correctly .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server respon@@ ds wrong@@ ly or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests into Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ ades , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of structural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , more wealthy family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over his head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ anza is generally not silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , there is the family that their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who as@@ simil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl becomes ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never get out of it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of heavy blows . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Registration Office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with just 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra took a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ st@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela held the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without documents it is much easier to hurt the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control what conditions boys and girls live under .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the daily life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ ades are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still alive .
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinners for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get an unlimited meal either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the host than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education that they had made possible .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken are bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ lands that are exposed to cri@@ p@@ ta when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group .

society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please register .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ event@@ h girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the advertisement was switched on again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was finished .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report of Cri@@ anza , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ anza , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former cri@@ p@@ ta , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , in which the Spanish con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , had to pay tribute to the Spanish con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores ) and the system of Mens@@ a ( in which the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations governing the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up which is mand@@ ated to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register with their correct names and identity numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , this could result in a sentence of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video directing and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the t@@ elec@@ om ministry in order to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall around Facebook on a national level . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technologi@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees , before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was en@@ visi@@ oned for those accused of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; annex@@ ing public order . &quot;
how a Kurdish prot@@ ector protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , animal rights activists H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who w@@ ander through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ op@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza points out in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends on the fact that there is a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore determines that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera @-@ all , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza happily portra@@ ys a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and in Nature Iraq &apos;s educational programs for six years now .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , which was responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the last six years to re@@ construct the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate neighbor@@ hoods were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had an atomic accident , alone that alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
housing in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( part of the community , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent makes the final light .
at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of housing shel@@ ters ( part of the part , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) must be reloc@@ ated to final spare parts .
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this respect . more than 75 percent of ev@@ ac@@ uation ev@@ acu@@ ated after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final homes .
the number here is 34 percent for I@@ w@@ ate .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear black@@ out zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma stays far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ates . it asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ athy has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o conducted a survey in order to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents said that it was still not done enough in the field of disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma did not only have to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
almost 63@@ ,000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses .
according to the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants live outside of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation stations are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma need to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country boundaries .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widely distributed photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer accused him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation into the incident .
the pictures show the police officer as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media group of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters ha@@ sten to it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brasili@@ an rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group participated , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a strike .
police hand@@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators was launched last Friday .
police were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber floors and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce loud speakers of violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported on a broken glass window , in order to illustrate their els@@ pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a scheduled bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence done by the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ forsaken Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the village of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory was gradually losing its facilities until the skel@@ eton of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose once more than a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization , according to the 2016 report .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories came to a halt , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated the most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree with the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first half of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially recorded documents , which differ only to the parts which would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any dem@@ ol@@ ocation .
from then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ med .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 employment years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane plant closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ assemble them , they also stopped to tar@@ ry the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people also left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to maintain their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ue David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus assumes that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ m@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always native to the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you will hear our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan , plastic dishes can be seen in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sanitary pur@@ u ( a part of the best , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic courts are so common that they do not attract them even more . however , a new trend is turning them today into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone decorated with plastic dishes as shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ers fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food items is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone stand .
we also manufactured this part for the Tokyo exhibition .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laughter is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise cow@@ or@@ kers or family members un@@ pleasantly .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag # for a few of the details .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry , for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sanitary pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and ge@@ aring regularly appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to go many kilometers in order to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid lives change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs following his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews , just one day .
priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task we have set ourselves , to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I &apos;m now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent or consider this as normal .
she continues writing :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hop@@ el@@ essness of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : &quot; as a family with threats was lo@@ oted , &quot; she describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money from their business for month until they had torn down not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never fa@@ des , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
in these terrible days , I wonder@@ ed if my tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation marked by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potato , keep tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier when he only removed a few blocks from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a violation of organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and the government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico entered into life the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has pl@@ agu@@ ed the country in the last four decades , in an intelli@@ gible way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which he links , contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ used to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this mis@@ p@@ pling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant meticul@@ ous coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus rav@@ aged . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to sail .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses lay in the streets scattered .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to lack of knowledge .
a picture titled &quot; Das ist Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows lined bodies lined up on the floor while people look at it .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what didn &apos;t happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an inhabit@@ ant on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo re@@ appeared , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and potential magnitude of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example mistakenly counter@@ pose the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange appeared in connection with the fatal prosecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who could flee , rape , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed in 2012 , Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein being said , monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but had not associated with it the image of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ tions date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixing mask of private sites , platforms of social media and collaborative as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which they were published on which side they were published . thus , we want to display the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
several examples of impro@@ per use may come from the countries listed below ( which have been linked to one another in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be fully tra@@ cked ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of incorrect coupling of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the Coun@@ tries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via the Tin@@ Eye , are likely to prove counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to delicate , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a statement on what it meant as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately dark news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this position , which was exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted His 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story along with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture is still contained in it at the time of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , which is now deleted from the Catholic close to the Catholic , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ dun@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo , endow@@ ed with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events which took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and ret@@ we@@ ded more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to false announcement .

frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the kill@@ ings of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the prolifer@@ ation of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and spectators , and they have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study that examined how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent depic@@ tions in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can also be used by the context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese din@@ osau@@ r ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ rem@@ esa ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist@@ s any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context is needed in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online @-@ list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
the blog contains , for example , words from the V@@ AT@@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - get tired of your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years .
and words spoken in the language of Hun@@ s@@ rik , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have war@@ med up on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Languages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wines here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
caused by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have entered the banks by heavy rainf@@ alls .
following a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Kat@@ astro@@ phy of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missed because of the floods and mud winds .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places .
rain dropped on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
tap water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly cur@@ es wor@@ sen the den@@ ial crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in the floo@@ d@@ water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are managed to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been helping to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this field .
the Taxi Service app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood help &quot; key which allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched a S@@ OS button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring citizens in need of security and provide help measures .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
last January I joined the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust her to her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next one we are calling for rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied out of an American flag , others say slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ duc@@ ted me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we are practicing our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit into it , they must be ab@@ duc@@ ted .
to be ab@@ duc@@ ted
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died .
but in the Western notion , religion was er@@ ased as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting ren@@ ders a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ sec@@ ted the story behind these images .
but these images are still prot@@ ru@@ ding today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er it .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , flaw@@ ed narrative domin@@ ates our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even choose their first female Pres@@ idential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong fol@@ ly weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought along with slaves .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and in@@ correctly occupied our collective imagination , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion things belong
in the news industry , we do more than telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create po@@ isons that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were the Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , whom all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all bags of bags with us .
we also don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological expert to be a Muslim or almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current tape by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have manipul@@ ated our already flaw@@ ed image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who tears the towel down a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the U.S. , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf would see that I am Muslim , if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses to protect the Koran and to be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim alle@@ gi@@ ance is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother , mat@@ ernal , with her sisters ; how to win a competition for the art of the arrangement of flowers in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her complete and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi holy ; and a Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means speaking the prayers she said to me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , which - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire &quot; which a company has founded with the name of the worthy British Eastern ini@@ di@@ ums company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan bl@@ amed around his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; being Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir subject of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy fa@@ des the US and the susp@@ ects we@@ ars a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen thousand years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing dup@@ licity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regimes which began with President Bush and were extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs that we disc@@ ard to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University experienced a scientifically wrong impression and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous figur@@ ative prints that we ste@@ er in our news editorial departments .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ RSS ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they are ruling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ ust track in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be w@@ aged and people are moderni@@ zed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance four decades ago was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of rein@@ forcing the &quot; other , &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president eating chocolate cake as he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other man @-@ made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
history of history , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the unmistak@@ able blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project , the following applies :
the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to these events &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to , feeling , feeling , soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their portra@@ yal lead to the audience &apos;s commitment to it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ mer@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the significance of his nav@@ el , John Ny@@ am@@ mer@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling tours .
Puerto Rico is calling for the US to re @-@ establish state debt
with the objective of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march began with the Moroccan Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic front for the ne@@ ural check of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial testing and a management committee with no personal interest in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the state @-@ federation integrated territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico demands a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be threatened without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night guard for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :
demonstr@@ ators are preparing for the march .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture hosted in Berlin , devoted itself to the event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; produced within three to five days , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Liberty : a Coll@@ ective Study ) .
the book published last year and is available here license @-@ free contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what is the real cost associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was crossed out of the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ ons , in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we chosen for ?
what have we abandoned at times of extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility , to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra &apos;s military court in A@@ dra on the basis of a command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were inside the Assad government on 12 November 2015 and informed them about an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the cultural prototypes had been more pre@@ ten@@ tious than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually having one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a proposition that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace
that every one of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guar@@ dians
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I bear with passion with myself ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
during the day
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sel &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope we have to do this last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : back to previous post due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to an attack on corruption , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence , in which the corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , in 2010 , was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants because of the mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the Moz@@ ambique airports , whose council held Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ attitude to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not pursue disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director back in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary action against the counter @-@ counter .
the company apparently kept silent and did not make reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be an advisor after having been sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company that helped him harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
un@@ disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no moral whatsoever :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe somebody is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted so heavily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serves the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served the state himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief enters prison :
thi@@ eves are not only remembered as the first independent president to the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of all , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he sat for 10 years and released .
and today the company , with which he grants money , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ stab@@ lem@@ ass ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( in German : @ Truth ) states that crimin@@ ality pays off in Moz@@ ambique :
in fact , in # Moz@@ ambique Di@@ eb and servant of # F@@ rel@@ im@@ o pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long possible prison , returns to # airports of Moz@@ ambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ angs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook gre@@ ets the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or as part of a part of the initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically recall hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ c@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ sier A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play of words .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is convinced that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of circul@@ ating rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you are writing on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook
in the post , the author expressed his opinions on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Khan believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but that &apos;s not how it works .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; stool &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t include hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to control the exu@@ ber@@ ant hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better working on context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age @-@ effective age is now at 18 .
before this change of the marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious groups adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere as that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; every man under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at creating laws for children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without a doubt they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du Guide , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , condem@@ ns themselves , to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them voted against it .
after deciding beforehand in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws for high@@ s were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is clothed in a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
there has been too much time and unnecessary talk that has veiled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
whereas Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally coming :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the Act has been adopted .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
the Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the plan to am@@ end the married couple was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there were 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all MEPs who were present have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago by law .
it was a long battle ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who fought it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be adopted , and he seems to release his promise .
while At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem , we would say that the state , which protects our daughters from preventing them from large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favour of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage is legal or is still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page - but in the cache it remained .

mirr@@ oring web pages allows Turkish users to view Wikipedia content
the english language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use circum@@ navigation tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized , pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete cens@@ orship difficult .
in spite of the legal ban , the content is accessible .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via the block of Wikipedia ) , we started to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it merely concerns screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a m@@ irr@@ or@@ page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ ali wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook , how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called in Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood before the face of the tiger face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the advancement of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care are to avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should respect the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , the exile of HIV and AIDS patients , and manages these clubs .
she tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in her discussion was women who did not name their hus@@ bands on behalf .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the discussion on the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify .
not utter@@ ing the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they are all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ eld and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name of her husband , wanted to try out at home as it is .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ ak of a secular tradition in which married women never can pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she was only kne@@ eling in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided they would actually try their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife couldn &apos;t stop telling his name .
another member of the club decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the marriage status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zin@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; point if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with each disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say something loud , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ad Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to go on a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the disc@@ us club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viol@@ a for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was a part of the &quot; The Beat@@ les Memorial Day &quot; in Japan &apos;s Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also today songs of the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is the day of the Beat@@ les .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places you must necessarily visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is the day of the Beat@@ les .
just in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of marketing , such as the R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! part of today is The Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are drag@@ ged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be a target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .
photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently informed that the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
be@@ ware of bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest mur@@ ders of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
veter@@ an Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches generated .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ icles of the B@@ log@@ gers &apos; poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mos@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed a country where people would be ashamed to claim sex against good marks , and girls would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to attain rapid riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , Human Rights Watch scientist for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both flat @-@ headed :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of bald @-@ headed people .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o drew attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he deemed it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , the Nobel prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , other countries have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at in the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ u as she announced in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions from Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they shall be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad so that he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message asks Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy prompted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the following to the couple :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a vote in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the Netherlands
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada City South Africa
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to say :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights .
France Vacation Rent@@ als list
France &apos;s foreign ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will ultimately accept it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ marks in Taiwan invited China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means for political reform and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u , by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a declaration on June 28 around Li@@ u and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are ultimately no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of this , he would inevitably appear un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , as well as cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system .
he cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to show his opinions as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to what country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leaders , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes this , associates properly and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review outlines the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a ud@@ der advoc@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of Singapore return to ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of wei@@ ghty significance .
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , but do they defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , where rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be revealed .
the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication I usually follow the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook inside of anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all the dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq , and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : being referred to as &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ying - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ers ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau em@@ bed the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ is Jun@@ ta
a pop band known in Thailand has released a music video which par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta who took power in 2014 and , in spite of their promises to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes .
although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video about the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was divided 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it concerns the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army an absolute decision about important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adju@@ st@@ ment change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest milit@@ ants and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors the online content and prosec@@ utes people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict face against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es is their decision to buy expensive Sub@@ mar@@ ines even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the sal@@ ute from &quot; The Tri@@ bute Of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ sia

the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Cau@@ ca@@ sia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ patri@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an War was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ ths , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and chi@@ ckens live in the area .
such settlements are also known as gh@@ ost@@ s in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost@@ s .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the entire population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen for over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey buildings of the Soviet Union dating from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ ska , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply for@@ ba@@ de us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get through the rounds .
in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will cultivate Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave Ab@@ ch@@ sia in order to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or a house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; she says .
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the soil .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will cultivate Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia broke off simply ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation draws to an end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy is ch@@ asing after him .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children are now scre@@ aming the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide for in@@ descri@@ b@@ ability in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken has been published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink brick frame and gold colored earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start shou@@ ting : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the road and that Afri@@ cans already talk about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are left to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found out that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border across the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula arrive from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests again .
in the courses travellers cal@@ m@@ ly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she flat@@ ters with numerous photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving , she has made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly while she introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone alert , in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities c@@ emented the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , ten Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had mess@@ ed up messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they installed the app .
in the communication of the police , the app would determine and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often associate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( a few blocks ) , which has published cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked the residents if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile message demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the translation technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( a few blocks ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which it emerges that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities published an ordin@@ ance with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able from both inside and outside .
one that makes all glory to their name .
one who has settled down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the play , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth moves on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn down during a peaceful protest , such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the city quarters sought , but not my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time even though I didn &apos;t set high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a sum@@ p@@ tuous picture that filled my expectations full and full .
in such a moment you realize that you are liber@@ ating the spirit from the light , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low up - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you scre@@ am All@@ ahu ak@@ bar , or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this day , the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I like all the details exactly before I enter the room .
unlike otherwise they have allocated me a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one prisoner , and I am allowed to sit down immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I grab@@ bed a tried and tested method of communication : beating against the wall with his fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Aid &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness there can be no striking facial features , and doctors are not there ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he is immediately inter@@ ro@@ gated .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all these crow@@ s , which refresh themselves in the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from a distance I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ aming , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Schwarz was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was aired : to protect the state security against us and to prevent that we expose the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tical dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye field of their view of the world .
this is not a home here ; it is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co @-@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of the facial expressions that are sli@@ pping him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than join the tap and protest in demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have used it to not responding .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I didn &apos;t have done anything to deserve this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to take as much meat as possible from the body as possible .
he calls the lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , probably from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you can &apos;t hold back your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t give him enough reason why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier than a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour , three of them changed while I was still in line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in doing so , which is why he moved next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and get away , you will be mis@@ placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he shifts to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced herself to flee from her village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these subjects are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version to U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation &quot; - so he den@@ otes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water dissolved N@@ es@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
evi@@ dently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protests against Islam .
in principle , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette are in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries .
this is why it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in the public during the Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sc@@ ary &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which raises the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian nation as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which still decided &quot; to use intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement would probably not be simple rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender norms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex @-@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently clou@@ ded unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ ants &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of voluntary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 , but it is still ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be det@@ ained in prison , &quot; and for their release often a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary that the woman will not take action .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been in@@ filtr@@ ated to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of the songs that are political at the heart can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song one verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note that his comments were torn from context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was uploaded on Youtube without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jordan do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they spoke cri@@ tically on comments in social media related to the problems rooted in the country &apos;s deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s concert is , according to opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought @-@ out and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will conver@@ ge with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , stra@@ y uni@@ tions and artificial demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and from a time when armies of west Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sh@@ ears and raz@@ ors

out@@ ward appearance and body care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate job such as that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic centre of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street theft and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and the unusual sty@@ ling of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dres@@ sers , which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts approach each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric look as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain an education in bar@@ ber art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud because of love for the children , we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel dis@@ ap@@ pointing ?
precisely this question left the young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) that encourage young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that young Colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to join forces and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as to welcome them back to society .
the campaign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more need@@ ful .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgently .
thus the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now need to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were as they had previously done to accommodate the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bus@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go there , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ row@@ er , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote such a beautiful thing , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also tired of war , I was tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society out there that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
in the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already there was war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State worked on the Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never found hearing before and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as a monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were made to know that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are prepared to grab arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a land in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not only come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published related to the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ as@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities arrested and arrested in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life she moved to the United States in the last analysis .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , made a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App did the round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two head@@ aches in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I first read his name at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they found absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny saying that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people spoke once my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate with a 95 on it under the window .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my Human Rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering without me , without notice , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you are security only because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I am actually trying to see how the person looks like , to whom she re@@ members from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during the Ram@@ adan , but also that they could hardly wait for the end of the Ram@@ adan and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite their relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced satisfaction with blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine said that there weren &apos;t so many .
when , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be present later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould you be killed , you will show your body on TV and claim that they have attacked some village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for a year and a half .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there was nothing new from them since then .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was when these people were taken .
until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer at that time than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed lashes , wore tu@@ bular je@@ ans and short loops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how long was this time of grace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television .
he did not talk about us per se , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change .
those who smil@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic has steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I still work as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I did not spend a cent on that .
I discovered these people myself when I shut off places of refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same like Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white foam in front of your mouth , that there are no gay men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines , have which , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet it exists - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who walk in the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know many think of transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me , it &apos;s the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not so sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to rise , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority and activists on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fol@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have joined this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to nour@@ ish their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the region where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy acquired power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are diver@@ ted .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian master director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who were looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % had a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since officials and institutions do not pre@@ tend to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired so that even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances surrounding the Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation will explo@@ de .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women - who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - have fru@@ stration .
they are wondering why I am not part of the movement .
they even put out well thought @-@ out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be feminine in general .
for example , women still earn less money today despite equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin color , rac@@ ism , black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention in which way we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black don@@ ors and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men in all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind , which refers to both sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my citizenship in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women again and again .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historic sense is a men@@ ial and margin@@ alized being .
I refuse to join groups , who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of bl@@ ending skin color and gender , as some of them continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was launched for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that black women define us according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana possibly : claim ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and where the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed congregations who can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and her tough@@ er fight against violence

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article entitled &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Struc@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent to her .
since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman presented Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s well @-@ informed announcement was also of no use .
a few days later the second wife returned to her display .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit , are victims of violence , are at all reporting to the law enforcement authorities .
content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate realization lashes and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are actually being mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are several indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office received 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of the ads of women came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mal@@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 women who do not do this are reported to any woman in Paraguay for the treatment of psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who don &apos;t do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this was to repent for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had insul@@ ted her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner had been mi@@ stre@@ ating them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) made up of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ predictable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a draft law was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for@@ dir ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Min@@ os movement ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ale is to declare a perpet@@ ual off@@ ence and to punish the hard@@ est as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text has been altered in some ways in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that are afraid that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is denied , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are punished with up to five years imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft law fores@@ een most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that must bear the victims of violence currently , if they just want to reimbur@@ se and receive safe accommodation to impose the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here so that violence is no longer perceived as normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the fact that the perpet@@ rators will be punished .
we have to refund for such a long time until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered beforehand , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack his victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law applies however as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the shortened and edited version of the article entitled &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Struc@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to be attacked &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the website of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Ottom@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid who came to power after he had ab@@ used his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the insist@@ ence of the security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of press , restric@@ ting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically cur@@ tail peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) has been reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court of Oman in order to raise a verdict in an inheritance case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page titled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial board , was invited to the special department from ISS and arrested on arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS took the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at in front of the court in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , by dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 Ottom@@ an ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ Abr@@ i , a ref@@ und@@ able deposit of 5000 dom@@ anian ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i during a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Ottom@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again ordered the Appe@@ als Court &apos;s decision to re@@ press the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further violations , for example , include the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and can exercise without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including arbit@@ ration ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of opinion and association as well as the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his understanding
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists will help build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Dis@@ eases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic was the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being self @-@ makers .
the solutions we get are often not very useful in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vis @-@ à @-@ vis Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been in the USA salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or truncated leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and car@@ rot varieties . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security to the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton continues to breed let@@ tu@@ ce , but it now needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like a rock b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to thread . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that patents on salads are too far away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new variety of salads , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ tious and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement growing in the U.S. and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for Open Source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus usable for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , shortly O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to being able to freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who purchase seed to breed it to breed their own varieties , and not immediately cut out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the emer@@ itus professor of University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seed and the possibility to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , the latest examples of the mer@@ ging of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer that are offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way in which this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed freely available to others , as opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant attributes .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all card attributes are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are pat@@ enting in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a Question of View@@ ing
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves until such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing due to more and more patents . currently , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property restric@@ ts other bree@@ ders as &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : wait 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the modified environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton , however , is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to facilitate farmers their work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ ther@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation methods are needed her@@ bi@@ cides , are bred into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most smaller seed companies can survive even without patents - either they reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , making it quite easy in my opinion . &quot; global resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the open source , the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , runs an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding vary from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not simply one to be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office that permits patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed patents .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems that should be the official launch next year .
an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report from organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers have the option of improving and improving seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also stresses the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly been paid to where and how something is grown and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government closed the site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about the above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities strongly critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - despite this attack and the exter@@ mination of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to im@@ part . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Ägypten : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web@@ side barriers . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles he writes for in Egypt in@@ accessible websites and media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government itself became the target of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blo@@ gger , the provider with which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting about the student protests and taking a video as the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blocking blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , an attempt to murder , sum@@ m@@ ons to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs , as well as any other web site I worked for .
2 ) They proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now after they have locked him and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
it also documented the blocking of suppliers through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer started .
such a practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that the Egyptian users could have access to .
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the managers of a local newspaper .
in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra , &quot; known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . whatever happens in the civili@@ zed standard , and what only happens in Rio , will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police , which only im@@ poses and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . this is , in her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to take responsibility for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ tional negl@@ ect of the public sector .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the murder rate per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has been in charge of the security policy of the state for many years , especially in South America &apos;s largest media company .
these security policy measures also included the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing unity there .
in the beginning , however , this led to a decline in violent deaths . for some years now , the U@@ PP , after several reports on har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , is increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux rec@@ ited from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this involves entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week later , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
in particular , the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organizations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , which led to the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and check@@ points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ chem@@ a and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that for three years now has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; gaining popularity . &quot;
to make money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ sac@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of fung@@ i , according to Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage locally produced plastic fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seeds origin@@ ating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis regions and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a state of state last week in solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region of Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas via satellite recordings , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some pictures shared by Twitter users :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers in Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
on Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity from case to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further on fires of this species .
these problems add that the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it exploited their own civil protection data through the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers didn &apos;t resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Africa .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar , heavier than himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by poverty and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy two times a day .
it is true that due to relatively high twin rates , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it took A@@ shar@@ af as well .
but his in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous will of life helped A@@ shar@@ per to get rid of these conditions .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have created companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu tells of the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ova and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ an &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail , and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ per with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development to the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
N@@ eti@@ zen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt allow dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the displacement of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft law that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of successful receipt of the law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or the final settlement of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty Members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another MP filed a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a senior official would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and government institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposition , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , according to legal experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is to be passed , this may mean three years &quot; imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ mine a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the res@@ ignation of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
as more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan had four years in prison for a court appointment .
his trial was recently postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including pseu@@ do @-@ ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court held in G@@ iz@@ a the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists to listen to passed documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s independent media platform and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April th@@ rows light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of law look .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the nam@@ ing of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which authori@@ zes journalists to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to new regulations of the information bure@@ au of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in the rules it is also stated that the registration with the full legal name will be required .
analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . until now , it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
will we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information prolifer@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law published in 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organise the publication of the information . &quot; the government also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to comp@@ el them on request for the delivery of user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es block Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the block Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia has refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was blocked because it was &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups in order to create a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among other things China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ling
after this week le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
